"All summer, I have been going to the Green Shack program at the playground near my house. This morning, my Green Shack leader introduces us to two new leaders from the Flying Eagle program.

"Our leaders teach us about the medicine wheel. They say that each nation has its own colours, but that the Cree people of Treaty 6 -- where Edmonton is -- use blue, white, red, and yellow, and these colours represent the different people of the earth. They ask us about our heritage, and one kid says he is Somalian, and one says she is part Ukrainian and part Irish. A few say they are Chinese. I don't know what I am!

"Later on, we make some totem poles. We pick animals that make us think of our family members, and we draw pictures of them on a paper towel roll. I draw a puppy for my little sister, because she is so cuddly, and a spider for myself, because I am good at making things. I draw a bear to be my mom, because she takes good care of us, and a fish for my dad, because he loves fishing.

"On Wednesday morning, we make dreamcatchers. Our leader tells us that the Anishinaabe were the first Aboriginal people to make dreamcatchers. They catch bad dreams in the web, and the good dreams float down the feathers to us. While we work on our crafts, our leaders tell us about the seven sacred teachings of the Anishinaabe: humility, honesty, respect, courage, wisdom, truth, and love. I decide to give my dreamcatcher to my grandma so I can show her how much I love her.",8,CC BY-NC-SA,Caylie Gnyra,"Dorothy Thunder, Susan Sinclair",en,0001_flying-eagle_en.md,global-asp/lcb-source,eng,Latn,lcb_0001,lcb
"After lunch, one of the leaders says we are going to ""smudge."" Smudging is one of the ways that Aboriginal people connect with the Creator. Our leader sets out a little metal pan and puts a braid of long grass that she calls ""sweetgrass"" inside. She lights the sweetgrass and it starts to smoke. The smoke smells sweet. I ask the Creator for good thoughts, good words, and good feelings as I wave the smoke over myself. Our leader says that each person can ask for the same things in their own way.",9,CC BY-NC-SA,Caylie Gnyra,"Dorothy Thunder, Susan Sinclair",en,0001_flying-eagle_en.md,global-asp/lcb-source,eng,Latn,lcb_0001,lcb
"After smudging, we get to have a fire! Our leaders show us how to make bannock. We roll the dough into a ball and put it on the end of a stick, and roast it over the fire like a marshmallow. It's delicious! It tastes like soft, warm bread. I put honey all over mine, which gets a bit messy, so I have to lick it all up.",10,CC BY-NC-SA,Caylie Gnyra,"Dorothy Thunder, Susan Sinclair",en,0001_flying-eagle_en.md,global-asp/lcb-source,eng,Latn,lcb_0001,lcb

"On Thursday, we play some neat games from the Arctic. Our leaders tell us that the Inuit people made up these games a long time ago, and they still play them. Everyone's favourite game is ""butt bump,"" where we try to bump each other off balance using our butts. We all laugh a lot together!",12,CC BY-NC-SA,Caylie Gnyra,"Dorothy Thunder, Susan Sinclair",en,0001_flying-eagle_en.md,global-asp/lcb-source,eng,Latn,lcb_0001,lcb
"After the hand games, we make Métis sash crafts by braiding colourful pieces of yarn together. Each of the colours means something important to the Métis people, like green, which stands for growth and success. Weaving all the colours together shows how the Aboriginal and European cultures of the Métis people are woven together. Afterwards, the leaders let us try on real Métis sashes. The boys wear their sashes around their waists, and the girls wear them over one shoulder.",13,CC BY-NC-SA,Caylie Gnyra,"Dorothy Thunder, Susan Sinclair",en,0001_flying-eagle_en.md,global-asp/lcb-source,eng,Latn,lcb_0001,lcb
"In the afternoon, we play lacrosse. It is kind of like hockey, except that we have to throw a little ball using a stick, and we run around instead of skate. I am a very fast runner! …but using the stick is tricky. I score a goal on one of the leaders, though! She tells us that Aboriginal people invented lacrosse. Cool! My friend can't run as fast as me, but he's good at catching the ball.",14,CC BY-NC-SA,Caylie Gnyra,"Dorothy Thunder, Susan Sinclair",en,0001_flying-eagle_en.md,global-asp/lcb-source,eng,Latn,lcb_0001,lcb

"Chuskit had been awake for the last hour. This was a day she was going to remember for a long time. Can you guess why?

No, it was not Losar, the New Year festival. That was many months away. Nor was it any special day in her village, like the gonpa festival, or a wedding day.

Today was going to be
Chuskit's first day at school. At nine years, she had waited a long, long time for this.",1,Public Domain,Sujatha Padmanabhan,,en,0004_chuskit-goes-to-school.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0004,pb
"The school was not very far away from her home. To get

there, you had to walk up to

the main road. Just before

the prayer wheel, you took

the path to the left of the

road that ran along a narrow stream. Near the poplar trees you crossed the stream by jumping over the big rocks.

Once you got to the other
side, a short walk up a slope
took you to the school. All
the children of Skitpo Yul,
Chuskit's village, walked to
school everyday and with
ease. But not little Chuskit. She had a disability and could not walk.",2,Public Domain,Sujatha Padmanabhan,,en,0004_chuskit-goes-to-school.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0004,pb
"Chuskit was born with legs that did not work like everyone else's. Her father had taken her to the village amchi and then to the doctors in Leh. But no amount of medicine had helped her walk.

At first, Chuskit did not realise that she was in any way different from the Stobdan her younger brother, or her cousins. But soon there were many things she could not do as easily as them.

“That does not matter,” her Aba-ley would tell her whenever she felt sad. “You can stitch better than any of them. And you draw very well.” Aba-ley often brought her some colour pencils from Leh.",3,Public Domain,Sujatha Padmanabhan,,en,0004_chuskit-goes-to-school.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0004,pb
"Chuskit would sit at the kitchen window everyday and draw what she saw while her Ama-ley cooked. She could see her family's animals being taken to graze every morning.

a visitor to their house!",4,Public Domain,Sujatha Padmanabhan,,en,0004_chuskit-goes-to-school.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0004,pb
"Chuskit used a chair fitted with wheels to move around. Elders called it a wheelchair. You could move it in any direction- forward, left, right and even backward - by moving the wheels with your hands. You only needed to have really strong arms to push the weight of your body and the chair.

When Aba-ley first brought the wheelchair home, everyone in her family was very excited.",5,Public Domain,Sujatha Padmanabhan,,en,0004_chuskit-goes-to-school.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0004,pb
"“Now I won't have to carry

Chuskit everywhere. I can wheel her around,” said Ama-ley, with tears of happiness in her eyes.

“And I will be able to go

wherever I want!” cried Chuskit excitedly.

“Please, please, could I ride on your wheelchair once in a way?” begged Stobdan.

He wanted to wheel it around too. It looked like fun. Billa, the big black cat, jumped on to the wheel-chair and stretched
across the seat.

“Yes this is far more comfortable than the sack cloth I sleep on,” she purred.",6,Public Domain,Sujatha Padmanabhan,,en,0004_chuskit-goes-to-school.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0004,pb
"Slowly, Chuskit learnt to use

her wheelchair. She would ask her mother to seat her in the wheelchair outside her home every evening.

From here she would watch children returning from school, chattering and laughing merrily in groups. In a while, the evening bus would return from Leh, bringing back people from work and the market place. How much more exciting the world was from here than from the kitchen window!",7,Public Domain,Sujatha Padmanabhan,,en,0004_chuskit-goes-to-school.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0004,pb
"One evening when Chuskit was sitting outside the house with her grandfather, a young boy came up to her. He carried a letter which he handed over to her grandfather. “Julley! The bus driver asked me to give this to you,” he said.
“My name is Abdul,” he said turning to Chuskit. “I study Class 6 at the Government School. I have often wondered why you don't come to school.”

“Julley, Abdul,” said Chuskit. “I have never been to school. The path to the school is too uneven and pebbly and my wheelchair will get stuck. Besides, I cannot cross the little stream in front of the school. It would be very difficult for my parents to carry me to school and back everyday.”

“But would you like to come to school?” asked Abdul.",8,Public Domain,Sujatha Padmanabhan,,en,0004_chuskit-goes-to-school.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0004,pb
"“Of course!” replied Chuskit. “I hear my younger brother talk of all that he does at school. I want to study like all of you, make friends, play games, wear a uniform and even write exams. Sometimes my brother
teaches me songs that he has learnt at school and I love it. You may not believe this, but I sometimes dream of carrying a school bag, even eating packed lunch...”

“Enough! Enough!” interrupted her grandfather.
“Stop dreaming, Chuskit. You know you cannot go to school. I have told you this many times. Learn as much as you can at home.”",9,Public Domain,Sujatha Padmanabhan,,en,0004_chuskit-goes-to-school.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0004,pb
"“Meme-ley, please,” pleaded

Chuskit softly with tears in her eyes as her grandfather walked away angrily. “Meme-ley does not understand how I feel,” said Chuskit. “I remember the day my brother recited his tables with such pride, even the time he learned to read! My parents were very happy as they have never been to school. I too want to learn to read and do math. Do you understand?”

“I do,” said Abdul.

“Chuskit, I will see you again. I must go now. My mother will be waiting for me. Julley!”",10,Public Domain,Sujatha Padmanabhan,,en,0004_chuskit-goes-to-school.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0004,pb
"The next day, Abdul went

straight to the Headmaster's

room after assembly.

“Julley, Azhang-ley!” he said. “I want to talk to you about a girl from our village who does not go to school. Her name is Chuskit. She is Stobdan's sister.”

“Oh yes,” replied the

Headmaster. “I know her. She is disabled, isn't she?”",11,Public Domain,Sujatha Padmanabhan,,en,0004_chuskit-goes-to-school.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0004,pb
"“Yes, Azhang-ley. She uses a wheelchair to move around but cannot reach school, as the path from her home is too rough and uneven. I was wondering if we could do anything to help her, Azhang-ley. We could all get together and level the path and also build a small bridge across the stream.”

“That's very thoughtful of you, Abdul,” said the Headmaster as he patted him on the back. “What made you think of Chuskit and her problems?”

“Azhang-ley, last week we read about the

fundamental rights of citizens in our civics class. All children have a right to education. That includes Chuskit as well, does it not?”

“Yes, you are right, Abdul. Let me discuss this with the other teachers,” replied the Headmaster.",12,Public Domain,Sujatha Padmanabhan,,en,0004_chuskit-goes-to-school.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0004,pb
"The next day the Headmaster called all the teachers to a meeting. He shared Abdul's ideas with the group and asked the teachers what they felt. “Impossible!” said one of them. “How can we have a disabled child in our school? How will she be able to write, play and go to the toilet like the other children do?”",13,Public Domain,Sujatha Padmanabhan,,en,0004_chuskit-goes-to-school.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0004,pb
"“That's exactly what we have to workout,” said the Headmaster. “I hear that in the village of Mentok Yul, the Village Education Committee has helped build a special toilet for one of their disabled children. We could ask them what they have done. But first we will have to get Chuskit to school. Then we could think of ways of helping her do things in school.”",14,Public Domain,Sujatha Padmanabhan,,en,0004_chuskit-goes-to-school.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0004,pb
"Two weeks later there was great excitement at the Government School. All the children had gathered outside in the playground. They had come to school without their school bags:

there were going to be no classes today!",15,Public Domain,Sujatha Padmanabhan,,en,0004_chuskit-goes-to-school.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0004,pb
The teachers divided the children into groups. One group worked in front of Chuskit's house and another on the path along the stream. A third group with some of the older children worked hard to help some of their teachers build a strong wooden bridge across the stream.,16,Public Domain,Sujatha Padmanabhan,,en,0004_chuskit-goes-to-school.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0004,pb

"Chuskit's parents provided everyone with hot tea and biscuits.

Chuskit's grandfather sat under a willow tree by the stream watching the busy school children. “I never dreamt I'd see a day like this!” he thought to himself as he wiped a tear that rolled down his cheek.

At the end of the day it was a tired but happy group of children that returned to their homes. The path from Chuskit's home to the school was now ready!",18,Public Domain,Sujatha Padmanabhan,,en,0004_chuskit-goes-to-school.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0004,pb

In any case, children did not like the teacher either.",4,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"Every morning, the teacher wrote things on the blackboard. In a loud voice, he told the children to copy it down on their slates. Then he would go outside. If the boys could copy his things from the blackboard nicely, the teacher looked at it. If they could not do it, the teacher got angry. When he was angry, he would call the children names and if he got very angry he would hit them hard.",5,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"One day, the teacher wrote some sums on the board. The sums were easy but they were boring. Moru did not feel like doing them and he did not have a slate. His slate had broken and his mother did not have the money to buy a new one.

Instead he counted the hundreds of ants that were climbing the wall. He looked at the tree outside and noticed that the leaves were perfect. Perfect leaves had perfect shadows. In his mind, Moru counted how many broken bricks there were along the school's compound wall. He calculated that if each brick costed five rupees it would take more than one thousand rupees to fill in all the gaps and broken spaces in the wall.",6,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"“Moru!” scolded the teacher. “Why are you not doing anything?”

Moru looked blank. “Where is your slate? Why haven't you brought one to school?” shouted the teacher. Moru could see that the teacher was angry with him. Moru replied, “My old slate broke and I don't have the money to buy a new one.” The teacher was angry and gave Moru a sharp tap with the stick in his hand.",7,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"Moru continued softly, ""Even if I had a slate I won't do the sums because I don't want to."" The teacher was furious. He slapped Moru. Moru's cheek burned bright red. Sudden hot tears sprang into his eyes. He stood up and ran out of the room, down the verandah, across the dusty playground, through the broken gate and away.",8,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"The next morning, Moru's mother woke him up in time for school. But Moru would not get up. He lay on the narrow bed with his eyes tightly shut.

Next day it was the same story, and the next day and the next. No one could persuade Moru to go back to school. One week passed and then one month. Moru sat on the wall in front of his house.",9,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"Sometimes he would disappear into the market for hours. He would try to fly his kite from the terrace but it was no fun because the sky was empty.

His mother scolded him, his brother teased him, his grandmother begged him, his uncle bribed him and his friends coaxed him. But nobody could persuade him to return to school.",10,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"The rains came and school opened after the summer vacation. Everyone thought Moru would go back to school with all the children. “No,” said Moru very firmly. A year passed.

Everyone gave up on Moru. Perhaps Moru gave up on himself too. Instead, he began to do other things.",11,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"He would go to the market and give the vegetable sellers a hard time. He would gang up with other children like him who had left school and tease and taunt the children who were going to school.

He would make paper airplanes out of the school notebooks of his friends. He would go up on the terrace and hit unsuspecting people who were passing by with pellets from his sling.",12,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"One day, the old teacher left. A new young teacher came in his place. That day Moru was sitting on the wall watching the children go to school. No one asked him anymore why he did not go with them. Instead, children avoided him because they were afraid that he would bother them.",13,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"The teacher was passing by. Moru looked at the teacher. The teacher looked at Moru Neither smiled and neither frowned.

The next day, at the same time and the same place, Moru looked down from the wall. The teacher looked up at him and smiled. It was a small smile. Moru jumped from the wall and ran away.",14,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"A few days later, the teacher was passing by. He was carrying a huge bag. The bag was very heavy. The teacher was having a difficult time. Moru scratched his head. The teacher passed him by slowly.

Moru thought and then he ran behind the teacher. Without saying anything, he took hold of one end of the bag. The teacher was relieved and together they were able to get the heavy load to the school quickly.",15,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"Inside the school , the bag was carefully put on the teacher's table. The teacher opened the bag and let Moru look inside. There were many many books, colourful books of all sizes and shapes. They felt shiny and smelt new.

“Can you help me to take them out?” asked the teacher.",16,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"Moru began bringing out the books. There were books with stories in them, with pictures on the cover. Some were written in large letters. Some books had so much in them that the words had to be squeezed into the pages. Moru felt his excitement rising. He had not touched a book in two years.",17,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"The next day, Moru waited till school was over and all the children had left. The teacher was alone. Moru went in quietly and stood by the door. The school seemed ghostly when all the noise and laughter and shouting was gone.

The teacher looked up and said, “Good you have come. I need your help.” Moru was curious. What kind of help could the teacher need? He had many, many children in his school to help him. In a very matter of fact kind of voice the teacher said, “Can you help me sort out the books?”",18,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"Moru sat on the floor. The books were all around him. There were so many storybooks.

He put the animal ones together. The leopard storybook would feel more comfortable with the elephants and camels. The fairytales could sit with the stories about gods and goddesses. The adventure stories sat on their own. Or maybe they should go with the heroes and famous people?",19,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"Then came the books with numbers. Moru's eyes and fingers slowed down. The fat numbers danced with the thin ones. Two digits balanced one on top of the other like an unsteady building still waiting for the base to be filled. The multiplication sums looked short and squat and got fatter and fatter at the bottom as the numbers got bigger.

Division was just the opposite. You began with a lot and then if you were careful, you worked it down to create a long thin graceful tail. If you were lucky there would be nothing left. One by one all the numbers and their tricks came back to Moru.",20,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"It was dark and the school had no lights. “You have to go home now, Moru, but you can come back tomorrow,” said the teacher. “But can you come when the children are here please?” Next day, soon after school started, Moru came. The children were surprised to see him and a little scared.

By now Moru was famous as a ‘dada' of the neighbourhood. “I have someone to help me now,” said the teacher. He put Moru with the younger children. There were books in which the children were supposed to write.

“Please, can you help the children arrange these numbers in ascending and descending order?” The little kids scrambled around Moru; they were amazed that a tough fellow like Moru knew so much.",21,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"Moru made the children stand in a line - the smallest children at one end and the tallest ones at the other end. He gave them numbers to hold. Now it was easy. Just like with short children and tall children, it is easy to know who to put where, it was the same with the numbers.

Every day Moru would come for a little while and every day the teacher would give him a bigger and bigger task to do. Every day he found his love for numbers was getting stronger and every day his excitement and skill was being absorbed by the little children.",22,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"One month later, Moru's mother was looking for him in the middle of the morning. He was nowhere to be found. She looked on the terrace but he was not there. She looked on the wall where he normally sat dangling his feet, but only his kites were resting there.",23,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"She looked up on the mango tree, the leaves rustled in the breeze but there was no Moru on the branches. She went to the market but all the vegetable sellers were selling their vegetables without being bothered by the usual gang of boys.

Finally, she walked down the lane and happened to look into the window of the school.",24,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb
"There was Moru. His head was down, and he was looking carefully into his notebook. There was a frown of concentration on his forehead and a deep look of absorption in his eyes. He was busy solving complicated mathematics problems along with all the other children of his age.

The teacher looked out too, and he smiled his soft warm smile at Moru's mother. She smiled back happily. Moru was in school again.

This time he was learning more and more. And most importantly, this time he was loving it.",25,CC-BY,Rukmini Banerji,,en,0006_counting-on-moru.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0006,pb

FIND OUT MORE!

Where does the sun go at night?

The earth is a sphere that revolves around the sun, along with the seven other planets of the solar system. One revolution of the earth around the sun takes one calendar year.

While it is going around the sun, the earth also spins on its own axis. Each ‘spin' takes 24 hours, that is, a day and a night.

Whichever part of the earth is facing the sun has day. At the same time, the other half of the earth (the part turned away from the sun) has night. Then the earth slowly spins around and the half that was in darkness (that is, the half that was turned away from the sun) now faces the sun. So this half has day, and the other half, which turned away from the sun has night. So, in reality, the sun does not really go anywhere at night!

Try this experiment!

To understand how the earth's rotation causes day and night, try this simple exercise.

You need:

A small rubber ball

A big torch

Some felt pens

A friend

What to do:

Imagine that the rubber ball is the earth. Using the felt pens, draw the map of the world on the rubber ball. Now, imagine that the torch is the sun. Ask your friend to switch on the torch.

Place the ball (the earth) directly in the path of the torch beam (sunlight), so that India is facing the sun. Turn the ball around slowly. What do you see? When India is facing the sun, the Americas are in darkness.

As India begins to turn away from the sun, Europe and Africa come into the ‘sunlight'. Then, as the ‘earth' continues to turn, the Americas come into the light and India becomes dark.

Keep turning the ball till India faces the sun again. This is what happens every time the earth turns around on its axis. During each rotation, India (and every other place on earth) has one day and one night.",14,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0011_sister-sister-where-does-the-sun-go-at-night.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0011,pb

"One harsh winter, many people in the land were sick. Ma
Monikazi's cheeks burned. Sweat dripped from her body. She
wanted to hold the icy grass to her face to cool down. Under her
blanket she held her belly and sang to the baby inside her: ""Be
strong, little one. Winter's not long. Be brave, little one. Together
we're strong!""

Her stomach growled when the baby's powerful kicks woke her at
night. She ate the leftover meat in the cooking pot, hungry for life.

One bright night the moon was
bigger, fatter and pinker than ever.
Her breath came fast. The baby was
ready. The aunties in the birthing
room rubbed her back and warmed
the water. When Monikazi held her
beautiful daughter in her arms, she
knew she was a special girl, a
fighter.

What a blessing! Her name is
Nontsikelelo. She will be the mother
of all blessings.",0,CC-BY,Liesl Jobson,,en,0015_together-were-strong.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0015,asp
"Nontsikelelo was beautiful and
strong with crinkling black button
eyes. She loved her older brother,
Mcengi. He made her laugh and so
the laughter spread. She loved to
eat meat before she had teeth. Her
favourite aunt always kept a little
portion on the side of her plate for
Ntsiki. Mcengi chased the chickens
that scratched in the garden where
Ma Monikazi grew spinach and
squash to feed her family. Ntsiki ran
after him as her legs grew strong.

Ma Monikazi had another baby boy, Velaphi, and another,
Qudalele. Finally another sister, Nomyaleko. Little Ntsiki folded
napkins and washed the baby clothes. She swept the house and
fed the fire. She picked up her baby brother when he cried and
tickled him till he laughed.

She taught them to sing: ""Be strong, little one. Winter is gone. Be
brave, little one. Together we're strong!""",1,CC-BY,Liesl Jobson,,en,0015_together-were-strong.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0015,asp
"Qingqiwe, her grandfather, raised
horses. His favourite was Shishi, a
glossy black mare. As soon as Ntsiki
was old enough, he hoisted her on
to the saddle in front of him. His
strong arms reached around her. He
laced the reins through her fingers.

He taught her to talk softly to
Shishi, to groom her with a hard
bristled brush. When she stroked its
glossy coat, Albertina whispered,
""You are the most beautiful
creature. Thank you for letting me
ride on your back.""

Her father, Bonilizwe, came home from the mines at Christmas.
Ntsiki pulled herself up onto Shishi's broad back. She rode out to
meet him at the bus stop. Ntsiki sat tall and straight. Her
knees held firm. She handled the reins with gentle fingers.
How proud Bonilizwe was of his daughter. The biggest smile Ntsiki
had ever seen covered her father's face.",2,CC-BY,Liesl Jobson,,en,0015_together-were-strong.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0015,asp
"On her sixth birthday she went to
school. ""You must choose an English
name,"" said the Presbyterian
teacher, but Ntsiki liked her own
name. ""Why do I need a new
name?"" she asked. The teacher
scowled and read the names aloud:
""Adah, Agnes, Albertina, Anna.""
What did they mean? Ntsiki liked
the long name best.

Al-ber-ti-na! The name had rhythm.
Al-ber-ti-na! The name had bounce.
Albertina was a name you didn't
mess with.

When her cousin married a handsome man from a nearby town,
Albertina was chosen as an umkhapi. The maid of honour! Weeks
before the wedding, she stitched her isikhakha, the short
traditional skirt, and threaded bright beads onto her amatikiti. Her
mother gave her the white flag and said, ""You have a big job, my
blessing.""

At the bend in the road Albertina waved the flag, then turned
Shishi back, leading everybody from miles around to the
ceremony. People would gossip if she made a mistake, but the
guests lined the road. They ululated and sang. They threw down
flowers for the horse and the girl.",3,CC-BY,Liesl Jobson,,en,0015_together-were-strong.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0015,asp
"Her mother was often sick and
needed Albertina to look after the
home. In her last year of primary
school, Albertina was the oldest
pupil in the school. She was chosen
to be the head girl and wore her
badge with pride.

Her best friend, Betty, told her
about a competition, saying, ""You
must apply, my clever friend.""
""What is the prize?"" asked
Albertina, growing curious.

""A scholarship to high school!"" said Betty. ""You must apply. You'll
win it, for sure.""

Albertina studied until the candle burned down. She practised
sums. She practised spelling. She sharpened her pencils and gave
her shoes an extra shine. Next morning she passed Shishi in her
paddock. The horse whinnied and stamped the ground.",4,CC-BY,Liesl Jobson,,en,0015_together-were-strong.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0015,asp
"The test began. Albertina's fingers
shook. The sums were tricky. Her
mouth went dry. Her hand cramped
on her pencil but she continued.

""Well done, Albertina!"" said her
teacher at the end. The important
official arrived and called the top
two students to the stage. ""Well
done to Albertina for full marks,"" he
said, ""but you are too old. The
scholarship goes to...""

Albertina tried not to cry. ""That's unfair,"" shouted Betty, hopping
with fury. ""That wasn't in the rules!"" How would Albertina go to
high school now? She dragged her feet all the way home.

The teacher wrote to the newspaper about the unfair decision.
Brother Joe at the Catholic Mission station read the story over his
breakfast. He cracked his boiled egg with an extra flourish. He
pushed the newspaper across the table to Father Bernard. He
didn't like the story one bit either.",5,CC-BY,Liesl Jobson,,en,0015_together-were-strong.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0015,asp
"Soon enough there was a
scholarship for Albertina. Mariazell
near Matatiele was a long way from
Xolobe, but the whole village
erupted. Their home girl was off to
high school. She would make them
proud. They threw a party like no
other. The women brewed the
sorghum beer and lit the fires. They
slaughtered chickens and stirred up
pots of meat. Albertina smiled till
her face ached.

She packed her brown suitcase and polished her shoes again.
Before setting off on the bus to
Matatiele, she said goodbye to Shishi. Albertina brushed her coat
and stroked her wiry mane. She whispered all her questions into
the horse's silky ear: What if I get lost? Will I make new friends?
Will I still be clever so far from home? Shishi whinnied and
stamped the ground.

School days started well before sunrise. The girls washed quickly
in the cold water and swept the dormitories before Mass. The milky
porridge was never quite enough; the stew not as tasty as Aunty's
back home. But Albertina studied hard. She played netball on
sunny afternoons.

In her school holidays Albertina worked at the mission station. She
rubbed and scrubbed against the zinc washboard. She boiled
sheets in copper tubs, then wound them through the wringer. She
hoed and tilled the school garden but missed her family. Who was
telling her brothers and sisters funny stories? Who wiped their
eyes when they cried? Who tickled them until they laughed?",6,CC-BY,Liesl Jobson,,en,0015_together-were-strong.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0015,asp

"Albertina took a train to
Johannesburg. She bought a smart
white uniform, new navy shoes and
a shiny red fountain pen. Sick
people came all day to the hospital.
She cleaned their wounds with
careful fingers. She held the old
people gently. When the babies
cried, she sang: ""Be strong, little
one. Winter's not long. Be brave,
little one. Together we're strong!

Some nights Albertina worked till dawn. She looked out the window
and thought of her family. Were the children hungry? Did they go
to school? Who was riding Shishi? She remembered the dark green
spinach. She missed the scent of the earth. There was no
vegetable garden here. There was nowhere for a horse.

Albertina never went to parties. She saved every shilling. On her
days off she learned to play tennis. Whoosh! Plop! She whacked
the ball across the net. Always, she wished for a little more money
to send home.",8,CC-BY,Liesl Jobson,,en,0015_together-were-strong.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0015,asp

"In a little hilly hamlet of southern India, lived a young girl called Bulbuli. She lived in a hut with her mother. Her house was surrounded by the tallest and greenest trees you would have ever seen. On misty days, the leaves of plants and trees held the biggest dewdrops you could imagine. Bulbuli was as sprightly as her name. She, along with her friends, would prance through the endless forests around her village. She loved to take in deep breaths every morning as the air carried all kinds of different aromas. Sometimes she could smell a sweet, sweet fragrance. At other times it was a strong and sharp scent. Then there were days when all she could smell was a familiar bouquet.",0,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"Waking up to those refreshing scents was the best way for Bulbuli to begin her day. Then there was Totaram the parrot, who would fly in to the village every morning, perch himself atop a tree facing Bulbuli's hut, and tell her of the entire buzz in the forest. He would also tell her of his flights to different lands and of people who lived there.

Bulbuli loved to hear Totaram's tales. She longed to visit these lands and see their different sights. Her heart would race and thump loudly as Totaram would speak but it would always end with a deep sigh. She had to stop dreaming of faraway lands when she had never even been to Senseless Point.",1,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"Everybody in the village talked of Senseless Point. A few people from the neighbouring villages had been there but no one from her own village. From all the talk around, it seemed like a mysterious place promising an experience of a lifetime.

Bulbuli believed that if she ever had the chance to go to Senseless Point, she would return to her hamlet and describe it to everyone. She would tell everyone about this mysterious place.",2,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"On this particular morning, Bulbuli waited for Totaram's whistle. She fed the hens and collected their eggs. Next she fed the cows and then milked them. All the while she paused from time to time to listen to Totaram's call. Tired of waiting, she left for her school. All the students in her school sat under a huge banyan tree.",3,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"Bulbuli could hardly pay attention to what was being taught. Her eyes searched for Totaram, who had never missed visiting her ever since the time they became friends.

Several days passed and Bulbuli grew more concerned about Totaram. She worried that Totaram might be hurt. She had no way of knowing if he was safe. Bulbuli grew more despondent with each day. After school, she would walk through the forests calling out to Totaram.

“Hello! Are you here somewhere Totaram?” she would yell cupping her mouth with her hands. But there was no response.",4,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"Then one very early morning, even before the sun had risen, she heard a very noisy and distressed bird call. She leapt out of bed and rushed out to look. It was Totaram. “Bulbuli! Wake up! I need to talk to you!”

Bulbuli stretched out her arm so that Totaram could perch on it. “Where have you been, Totaram? I have been so worried about you. What is the matter? You seem very upset!”

“There is trouble at Senseless Point. War has broken out in the forest.”

“Calm down Totaram or you will wake the entire village. What kind of trouble are you talking about? And who is at war?” asked a puzzled Bulbuli.

“The jungle... Oops! Sorry, Bulbuli. I do need to stop screaming. The jungles are at war. Senseless Point is not what it used to be. All the animals are frightened. They do not know what is going to happen next. Bulbuli, we have to think of something,” cried Totaram anxiously.

“I still do not understand. How can jungles be at war? Why don't you take me to Senseless Point?” said Bulbuli.",5,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"Totaram grew even more agitated. “Senseless Point is two sunrises and two dusks away. Your small feet will not be able to carry you there.”

“My mind is bigger than my feet, Totaram. Don't let the size of my feet fool you. I'm not afraid to do difficult things. Besides, the least I can do is try.”

“The journey is long and hard, Bulbuli. I'm not sure...” mused Totaram.

“Well, I cannot think of any other way to help. You must take me to Senseless Point,” pleaded Bulbuli. Totaram thought for a long time. Reluctantly, he agreed. “All right then, but we must leave immediately,” he said.",6,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"Just then Bulbuli realised that she could not leave without telling her mother. Totaram suggested that they stop on the way to get Koyal, his friend to tell her mother first thing in the morning.

“Hurry now. We must not lose any time,” Totaram urged.

So off they went. Totaram flew just above Bulbuli's head and led the way. Bulbuli walked and walked for several hours. She was not unused to walking through thickets and tall grass. But then she grew hungry and tired. Totaram could see that she needed to eat and drink.

“Just a little longer Bulbuli. There are coconut trees up ahead,” said Totaram. When they reached the coconut plantations, Totaram let out a shrill whistle. “Whoeeeee...”

From nowhere swung a frisky monkey. He was so full of beans that Totaram had to chide him.

“Calm down, Bandaroo! I have work for you. Stop prancing around.”",7,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"“Alright Totaram. What is it?” asked Bandaroo.

“Pluck a couple of coconuts and toss them below. My friend Bulbuli here is hungry,” informed Totaram. Bandaroo obliged. He threw three green coconuts down. They split open as they crashed to the ground. Bulbuli hungrily reached out for them and scooped out the creamy kernel. She ate quickly when all the while Bandaroo squealed with delight from the tree above.

“Thanks Bandaroo. That was filling,” said Bulbuli.

“Call me anytime folks. I'm the best thrower in the jungle,” said Bandaroo chirpily.",8,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"Totaram and Bulbuli carried on with their journey. After several hours, Bulbuli grew weary and exhausted. However, she was not going to give up. She had an opportunity of a lifetime here. A visit to Senseless Point for people around her village was like a pilgrimage.

Each time that she felt fatigued, Bulbuli tried to picture Senseless Point in her mind. She imagined a beautiful place that could fill people's hearts with happiness. That scene in her mind was enough to make her forget how footsore she was. The first dusk of their journey set in. ‘Another day to go,' thought Bulbuli. Bulbuli rested under a tree while Totaram found a comfortable spot on a branch above. Soon it was dawn.

Bulbuli was awakened by the chattering of what seemed like a million birds in the jungle. Bulbuli took several big breaths and stretched her arms out to wake up her body. The morning felt different. She could smell all the familiar scents that she used to every morning, but somehow, they were stronger and more refreshing.",9,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"“Totaram! Can you smell the freshness in the air? I love it!” she told the parrot. “You have all day to take your whiffs. Let us get moving,” ordered Totaram. Totaram and she talked little the next day. He could see that Bulbuli was tired, hungry and thirsty.

Totaram flew down to perch on her shoulder. “There is a stream nearby. We will rest there for a while.”

In a little while, Bulbuli heard the sound of rushing water. In no time they arrived at the stream. The

clear water glistened in the sunlight. The water seemed to be racing with itself to get somewhere. It was a

beautiful sight.

Bulbuli leaned over and cupped the water in her hands and drank all that she could. She splashed water on her face and refreshed herself. Just as she was done, Totaram landed on her shoulder once again and nudged her to stretch out her palms. He then dropped red, delicious berries in them.",10,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"“Oh Totaram! You are the nicest friend I know. Thank you so much,” smiled Bulbuli. “Go ahead and eat them. Berries are my favourite food. I have already eaten too many today!” gushed Totaram. They rested for a while and then set out once again. Bulbuli walked and walked while Totaram flew just above her talking to her all the while.

After several hours, Bulbuli sat down. “I need to rest Totaram. I am really very exhausted. Totaram let out a loud whistle. Within minutes, an elephant strolled up to them. Totaram introduced Hathi to Bulbuli and told him of their journey to Senseless Point.

“I believe only a human can help the war in the jungle. Animals are running away from what is paradise for us,” said a concerned Hathi. “Will you give Bulbuli a ride, Hathi?” asked Totaram. “Her will is strong but her strength is failing.”",11,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"“Of course. Climb up, little girl, but I can only take you up to the trail. After that you are on your own. I cannot be away from my group for long,” said Hathi. Bulbuli was relieved. Her small legs needed rest and she was able to get a spectacular view of the jungle from atop Hathi's back.

Hathi, like Totaram, had many tales to tell. The day passed easily. At dusk, the trio settled by a cave. Totaram and Hathi gathered dried leaves and straw and made a bed for Bulbuli. As soon as Bulbuli lay down, she dozed off. At the third sunrise, Totaram did not have

to wake Bulbuli.

She was up at the crack of dawn. Totaram brought her some purple berries this time, which she ate with delight. The young girl, the parrot and the elephant began the last leg of their journey. Bulbuli was becoming more uncertain of what to expect. First there was the anticipation of Senseless Point. Then there was the uneasiness of the jungles at war.

As she was getting closer to her destination, her heart began to fill with thrill and excitement but with a tinge of apprehension.",12,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"Shortly, Hathi stopped. He said, “It is time for me to say goodbye. I must return to my family. All the animals will be grateful to you if you could help end the war of the jungles. We cannot bear to live anywhere else. These jungles have been our home for generations.”

Bulbuli thanked Hathi for carrying her as far as he did.

“I hope the jungles hear me out, Hathi. I promise to do my best.” Totaram sat on Bulbuli's shoulder and asked her to slow down. “Look at that trail going downward. That will lead us to Senseless Point,” instructed Totaram.

At this point, a strange humming sound enveloped the jungle. As they walked further, the noise grew louder and louder. “Where is that noise coming from?” asked Bulbuli covering her ears.

“That is the sound of three jungles at war, and it is only going to get louder as we approach Senseless Point,” hollered Totaram.",13,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"Bulbuli could barely believe what was going on. Never before had she encountered such a scene. As she climbed down the trail and looked around, she saw nothing out of the ordinary. But the clamour was ear splitting.

Totaram pecked at her ear to get her attention. With the shrieks of the jungles, Bulbuli could hardly hear Totaram. With three more steps, Bulbuli found herself amidst a clearing. It was as if all the trees of the jungle had suddenly disappeared. There were hillocks stretching as far as her eyes could see.

“This is Senseless Point. This is a place where everything grows wild. Humans hardly ever come here,” said Totaram. Then Totaram began screaming, “A human being is here, a human being!” But in the deafening din of the jungles, his voice went unheard.

Bulbuli could not get herself to remove her hands from her ears. She could not understand what the jungles were saying, but by now it was clear that there were three jungles involved.",14,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"In the distance, just in front of her, she could see green beds. On her right, were hundreds and hundreds of shrubs with magenta flowers. On her left, she could see very tall plants. The sight before her was breathtaking. And the aroma was stunning.

Bulbuli's face lit up with wonder. She turned towards each jungle several times over, to take in the splendour. Almost instantly, the noise of the jungles began to die down, as if the jungles had spotted her.

That was when Bulbuli took her first deep breath. She could smell the aroma of tea. Then in the next breath, she was drawn to the fragrance on her right. It was a spicy fragrance- something she was familiar with. Unsure, she breathed in some more and said to herself, “Ah! Elaichi!”",15,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"A gentle breeze pushed her to her left. Her head turned and she smiled when she took in her next deep breath. It was an attractive and pure smell. Instantly, she recognised the plant.

Bulbuli joined her hands and bowed with reverence. “You are Tulsi!”

Bulbuli was overwhelmed by the fragrances. They smelled like three octaves of the same musical note – Sa, Sa, Sa. Bulbuli felt joyful. She stretched her arms and twirled around with her eyes closed.",16,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"The fragrances and the musical notes played in her head, over and over again. All her senses were alive. This was a magical moment for her. Never before had she felt so delighted.

Just then, the elaichi plant spoke, “Maybe this little girl could punish the tea bushes.”

“Maybe. Little girl, can you stop the tea bushes from stealing our fragrance?” asked a Tulsi plant.

Bulbuli was stunned to hear the jungles speak to her. Before she could respond, a tea bush spoke up. “Maybe if these two were not around, humans might be able to ap-preciate our aroma.”",17,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"“Is that what this war is all about, worrying about your smells getting stolen?” asked a puzzled Bulbuli. She smiled to herself. “Do you have any idea what you all smell like from where I stand? I can smell each of you distinctly.”

“It really is not our fault. We are not fragrance thieves. Our leaves take on the smell of anything that grows around us. In fact, with tulsi and elaichi around us, we have to work extra hard to keep our identity. It is not as if the tulsi jungle and the elaichi jungle have lost their perfume to me. You just said that you can smell their individual whiff,” said a tea bush.

Bulbuli took several deep breaths to calm down. She discovered that every time she took in a collected breath of tea, elaichi and tulsi, it helped her relax. There was something very soothing about the three of them together.",18,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"“My mother has taught me important things from the Vedas. Do you know what they have to say?” asked Bulbuli. “The sun should be a giver of happiness, the sky should be a giver of happiness, and all trees and plants should be givers of happiness. All these should give us peace of mind. Do you think you are doing that?”

The jungles fell silent. They were listening to Bulbuli. Bulbuli had an idea. She whispered something to Totaram. He flew off from her shoulder almost immediately.

A tulsi plant spoke. “The elaichi and tulsi grow wild. We have no control over where and how we grow. And neither do we tell the wind which way to blow.”

Bulbuli thought for a moment. “In that case, how can you blame the tea? Maybe you ought to blame the wind.”",19,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"“The wind! Tulsi and Elaichi fight constantly with the wind too. They do not want the wind to take their perfume out of here,” said a tea bush. Bulbuli was aghast. “Is that true?” she asked.

Neither of the two guilty jungles replied. Bulbuli sighed deeply. Just then Totaram returned. He carried a few tulsi leaves, some elaichi seeds and tea leaves in his beak and placed them on Bulbuli's palm. Bulbuli gently rubbed them together. She raised her palm to smell them. She let out a loud delighted shriek.

The jungles screamed back in unison, “What is the matter, little girl? Are you all right?”",20,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"Bulbuli laughed with joy. “You can now wave the white flag for peace. I have a bit of all three of you in my hand and together you smell like nothing else in the world. One whiff of all of you together is so relaxing.”

Totatram whispered in Bulbuli's ear. She smiled. “Totaram tells me that the animals in the jungles have known just which leaf to eat when they are unwell. Even the birds have eaten your fruit and leaves together to know how quickly you can make them better again. Did you jungles even know that?” asked Bulbuli.

“These animals eat your leaves to relieve all kinds of sickness. They even come here to Senseless Point to rejuvenate themselves. Totaram, get me a bunch of tea, elaichi and tulsi. I am going back home to brew a warm cup of tea with tulsi and elaichi for my mother. Celebrate, jungles! The world is going to know how well you taste together. Which means that you have to get on well with each other. Can you do that?” asked Bulbuli.",21,CC-BY,Tanya Luther Agarwal,,en,0027_jungle-brew.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0027,pb
"Bulbuli and Totaram giggled. So did the jungles. This time the noise level rose not because of the fighting, but with laughter. Bulbuli was relieved to see the war coming to an end. She realised that the jungles had each been able to feel pride in their uniqueness.

Bulbuli asked Totaram to collect bunches of tea, tulsi leaves along with elaichi seeds. “Jungles, I am now going to return to my village with the most exquisite and refreshing tea, one with tulsi and elaichi. And I promise to return with people from my village to introduce them to Senseless Point. The most refreshing place on earth!”

"The royal orchard looked lush after the rains. The earth was soft and wet and had a delightful fragrance. The trees looked like they had been washed and each leaf looked like it had been polished by hand.

The head gardener was getting a new tree planted. He directed his helpers to a pit that had been prepared just that morning. The young tree was carefully lowered. All along, the head gardener kept saying, “I will lose my job and all of you will rot in the darkest chambers of the palace if this tree does not survive. And if it blooms, you won't have to work another day in your life. You will all be handsomely rewarded.”

As an offering to Mother Earth, he threw in sugar cane juice, before the roots of the young tree were patted with mud. Just then the King and his young prince stepped into the orchard.

This was to be the first walk among the trees for the prince with his father. “Father, what is this sapling?” asked the prince, pointing to a plant. “It is a pomegranate sapling. The tree that will have the most beautiful flowers...”

The prince watched his father admiring the trees around them with love and care.",0,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"Pomegranate

It is hard to say which is more beautiful - a pomegranate fruit or the brilliant red flower. The fruit has a deep red colour and is the size of a cricket ball.

It has leathery skin and when it is opened, you find many red, juicy seeds, which look as though they are made of glass. Each seed has a woody, crunchy centre. Some fruits are yellowish pink and have pink seeds. These are also very tasty.

The pomegranate tree grows to about three metres. The long and narrow leaves are shiny and the branches have a few thorns. In the spring, the tree is covered with scarlet flowers. The petals look as though they are made of crinkly paper.

These flowers have no smell. The petals grow out of a red part called the calyx. After the petals fall, the calyx begins to grow bigger and bigger till it becomes a pomegranate with a crown.",1,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"Pomegranate juice is very tasty and is taken to bring down fever. Pomegranates contain plenty of natural sugars and vitamin C. The dried seeds are made into sour anardana, which is a spice used to flavour pakoras and aloo paranthas. The rind of the pomegranate is dried and powdered and taken to cure an upset stomach.

Pomegranates are called anar in Hindi. One of the most renowned dancers in the court of Mughal emperor Akbar was called Anarkali — bud of the anar — because she was so beautiful.

Some pomegranates are called kandhari, as once they were only grown in a place called Kandahar, in Afghanistan.",2,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"Jackfruit

The jackfruit grows on a tall tree with a thick foliage of dark green leaves. The jackfruit does not grow just on the branches like other fruit, but also on the tree trunk.

Another amazing fact is that when the jackfruit tree turns very old, the fruit can also grow on those roots which come out

above the ground.

The large, oblong fruits can sometimes weigh as much as 40 kilograms. Their rough skins are covered with conical studs. When jackfruits are young they are green and eaten as a vegetable, but when they are ripe and turn yellowish-brown they are eaten as a fruit. The ripe fruit has a strong characteristic smell and not everyone likes it.",3,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"The seeds of the jackfruit are also very tasty. They can be roasted and eaten. Fried jackfruit makes delicious chips. When sugared and dried, the fruits make excellent candy. The leaves are warmed and used to foment wounds and stop swellings.

The wood of this tree is not attacked by termites. An orange dye is made by boiling the wood. This is used to colour the robes of Buddhist monks. When two sticks of the jackfruit tree are rubbed together, fire can be produced.

The tree is very ancient and it is mentioned in Sanskrit texts as the panas. It is the largest tree-borne fruit in the world. This tree has its origin in India. The fruit is very nutritious, as it has carbohydrates, proteins, some fats and vitamins.",4,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"Papaya

When we cut open a golden orange papaya, we find a lot of shiny, black seeds that look like whole black pepper. Can you imagine how many trees can grow from each fruit — at least 500! But not all the trees that grow from the seeds will give us fruit. This is because some trees have flowers that are male and other trees have flowers that are female.

When we plant many papaya trees together, it ensures that cross-pollination takes place and the ‘female' trees bear fruit. The fragrance of papaya flowers is very sweet. Insects and birds help in pollination and little papaya fruits begin to form.",5,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"The tree has big leaves that are thickly veined. When they dry, they fall off leaving a scar on the trunk. The wood of the trunk is not hard. It is soft inside, rather like the stem of a big plant.

Papayas are very nutritious, with lots of vitamin C and A, and calcium too. Raw papayas are used as a tasty vegetable. Papayas have an enzyme called papain, which is useful for digestion. Raw papaya helps in tenderizing meat.

Ripe papaya pulp is good for skin problems and is used to get rid of spots and blemishes on the skin. Papayas came from Mexico and Central America. But they are seen almost everywhere in India!",6,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"Banana

Some banana trees are as tall as a single-storeyed house while others are only as tall as a person. The leaves are sometimes one-and-a-half metres long and over half a metre broad, with a thick rib running through the centre.

The new leaves have a fresh green colour but as they grow older, they become darker and get torn at the edges. The trunk of the banana has no bark. It is actually a thick stem made of the stems of the leaves that are tightly wound around each other.

The flowers of the banana tree grow inside a reddish cone. Hundreds of tiny white flowers can be found inside each cone. As many as a hundred bananas can grow together in a bunch. When the bananas are almost ripe, the bunch is cut down and left to ripen.",7,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"Raw bananas are eaten as a vegetable. Delicious chips can be made from raw bananas. Banana flowers are used to make tasty curries. Monkeys and elephants love bananas. An elephant can eat many bunches by himself!

Bananas are nutritious as they have many vitamins such as A, B and C, as well as calcium, which is needed for our bones to grow strong.

It is also a good source of minerals like potassium and magnesium. Bananas are considered auspicious by Hindus and are offered during a puja. When there is a wedding or a puja, the trees or bunches of bananas are used to decorate both sides of the entrance to the house. The leaves make wonderful, natural plates. The leaves are also used to make cups.",8,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"Jamun

The jamun tree is tall and graceful, with a grey-brown bark and deep green, long oval pointed leaves. The trees always have dense foliage. They grow about 12 metres tall. Children love to play beneath their deep shade. The bark is smooth but the wood is weak so the trees are not very safe to climb.

From March to May, the tree is full of bunches of tiny creamy flowers, which bees and other insects love for their nectar. We all wait for the rains, when the jamun gives delicious, deep purple fruit with a stone in the centre. The ripe fruit is sweet-sour and good to eat. Ask any parrot or squirrel, or even fruit bats that come to eat the juicy berries at night!

Jamun trees often grow wild in forests and according to Hindu legend, Krishna loved to eat the fruit when he grazed his cows. The dark purple colour of the fruit is supposed to be the same colour as Krishna's complexion. Lord Ganesh is supposed to love this fruit too. The tree is also sacred to Shiva and Vishnu.",9,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"This tree is originally from India. The name jamun, comes from the word Jambu Dweep, as India was once known in the olden days, since it was supposed to be full of jamun trees!

Ripe jamuns are very tasty when they are eaten with rock salt.

In the forests when wild jamuns fall from the tree they are eaten by bears, deer, monkeys and other small animals.

The bark and seeds of the jamun are dried and powdered and then used as a medicine for diabetes. The fruit is rich in fruit sugar, iron and vitamin C.",10,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"Guava

Guavas are really delicious! Ripe yellow ones are tasty, but the crunchy green ones are mouth-watering too, especially when sprinkled with salt and masala.

Have you seen a guava tree? It is not very tall, possibly as tall as a single storeyed house. The trunk is slender with a grey-ochre bark that peels off in strips. The leaves are oval and rough to touch. The tree is full of beautiful, five-petalled white flowers, towards the end of winter and then again at the time of the rains.

When these flowers fall, small green guavas begin to appear. At first, the fruit is green and hard. As it ripens, it becomes softer and the colour becomes a creamy gold.

The flesh is white and in the centre, there are lots of woody seeds. Some guavas have pink flesh. These are also very tasty. Another type of guava is deep red on the outside.",11,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"Guavas that ripen in the winter are always tastier than those found during the rest of the year. In India, Allahabadi guavas are famous for their taste.

There are so many guava trees in India that it is hard to believe that they came from Brazil in South America. Sailors travelling from those parts, brought the seeds of guavas with them.

Parrots and monkeys love guavas. It is believed that a guava pecked by a parrot will be sweet!

Guavas are very good for us as they are full of vitamin A and C. The tree has other uses too. The leaves are mashed and used to relieve toothache. The bark is used to make a dye for colouring silk.",12,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"Coconut

Graceful coconut trees grow in sandy soil, in the tropics where the weather is warm and wet. Coastal areas have the largest number of coconut trees. This tall tree has a slim trunk, which bends with the strong breeze that blows in coastal areas. Because it bends, it does not break.

The water inside green coconuts is very tasty and nutritious. It has sugar, protein, amino acids, and minerals like calcium, iron and copper, and vitamins. As the fruit becomes ripe, it turns brown and hard and the water inside becomes sweeter, until it is quite dry. Coconut oil is extracted from the flesh when the nut turns brown and woody.

Each coconut leaf has a long central rib with smaller hard leaves growing on either side. Waving in the breeze, coconut leaves resemble the feathers of some giant bird. The leaves are plaited to make baskets and mats, and also to make thatched roofs. The hollowed out trunk is used as boats.",13,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"It is amazing that even the husk, that encloses the shell of the coconut, is used for making ropes, mats, brushes and to stuff mattresses.

All over the world, the coconut tree is prized for its different uses. Sometimes it is known as the tree of heaven. It is supposed to have come from the Melanesian islands in the Pacific Ocean.

If you had no other tree but the coconut, you could build a house, have a meal and a cool drink, make clothes from leaves, make a broom and even have a soft mattress to sleep on! Can you think of any other uses?

The coconut is a symbol of prosperity.",14,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"“Father, why are these trees so special to you?” asked the prince. “Son, these trees grow in different parts of India and during my travels to different states, I have chosen the most delicious fruit trees of those regions. They all need different kinds of climate to survive. But, here, our soil is so rich and our gardeners so dedicated, that they have been able to raise all these trees. Look at this one. It is a ber tree.”",15,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"Ber

Sometimes on the way to school or walking around the edges of fields, we come across ber bushes. They are thorny, but the little red fruit with a stone in the centre is worth plucking because it is very tasty.

There are many different types of bers, some grow on trees with graceful, drooping branches whereas others grow on bushes. Some are round and others have a longish shape, but they all have a wonderful flavour. Ber trees can be about six metres tall and the bushes are only about one metre high. The ber tree and the ber bush are both thorny. The trees have longer thorns and that is why when bers are ripe, people take a long stick with a sharp knife at the end of it, to cut down ripe bers. Sometimes, if the branch is shaken hard, the ripe fruit drops down and can be collected. Ber trees grow in dry places where it does not rain too much. The leaves are eaten by goats, camels and cattle.

Silkworms also eat the leaves of the ber. Another very interesting insect called the lac insect lives on the branches of the ber. The insect sucks the juice and secretes a red substance called lac, from which paints, varnishes and dyes are made.",16,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"Orange

We all wait for juicy oranges in the beginning of winter. The tangy smell of a peeled orange is unmistakable. It comes from the oil in the rind.

The orange is easy to eat because it can be peeled and each section eaten separately. It is also a great thirst quencher on a hot day.

Oranges are full of vitamin C, which keeps colds and coughs away. They also have calcium which is good for strong bones. Orange juice is a popular drink and the flavour of oranges is used in many food products.

The best oranges in India come from Nagpur. The trees are about six metres tall, and somewhat thorny.",17,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"The leaves are dark green and glossy. If you crush a leaf between your fingers, it has a strong tangy smell. If you sit near flowering orange trees, the perfume is very soothing. That is why the flowers are dried and then stuffed into pillows for a good beauty sleep.

The rind of the orange is dried and mixed with gram flour to make a scrub for the skin. This can be used instead of soap. In the olden days, ladies in China carried oranges in their hands to keep them smelling sweet.

It is thought that the orange tree came from the southern parts of China. Some people think that its origin lies in the foothills of the Himalayas.",18,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"Chikoo

When round, brown chikoos grow on trees, they remind us of soft, brown balls. The skin is a bit fuzzy, and the brownish flesh within is very sweet and has a grainy texture. The chikoo has shiny, long, black seeds inside. The leaves of the tree are longish and glossy. The tree can reach a height of about 10 metres.

This tree was brought from South America many years ago where the Aztec Indians called the tree Chicle. They tapped the bark for the rubbery gum that oozes out of it and made an ancient chewing gum from it. This is how the idea of making chewing gum came to people's minds in modern times. The word chikoo comes from chicle.

Chikoos grow best in warm and humid places. The best chikoos come from Maharashtra and central India. In some parts of the world, the chikoo is known as the Sapodilla.

This fruit has a very high sugar content. It also has a good amount of vitamin C. In some places, the seeds are made into a paste to cure insect bites and stings. Chikoo ice cream is delicious. Have you tried it?",19,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"Tamarind

The tamarind tree grows to a height of over 20 metres. It has a long straight trunk with dark brown bark. The branches are strong and supple and droop downwards. The tiny leaves are of a fresh green colour and form graceful, feathery foliage. They are also sour like the tamarind and are nice to eat.

The tamarind has beautiful yellow flowers with thin streaks of red. When the flower dries up, its place is taken by a tamarind pod. The pod is green and gradually turns a light brown as it ripens. It is like suede to touch.

When it ripens in winter, it becomes a deep brown and the pulp inside is sour with a hint of sweetness. Tamarind seeds are dark brown and enclosed inside the pulp. Squirrels and birds love to eat ripe tamarind. Children also love raw tamarind dipped in rock salt, though it can give them a sore throat sometimes.

Tamarind is used to make delicious curries, pickles, chutneys and tangy jal jeera, which is not only cooling in Summer, but also delicious with gol gappas.",20,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"Tamarind is very rich in iron and vitamin C. The seeds are dried and powdered and can be used as a flour. Tender tamarind leaves and tamarind flowers are also used in cooking.

The tree gives very dense shade in summer. There are many superstitions in India about the tamarind tree. People believe that ghosts live on its branches and that one must not sleep under it at night.

If you look closely at the leaves of a tamarind tree at night, you will notice that they fold up. Of course, the truth is that, because the big tree breathes out carbon dioxide, it is not healthy to sleep under it at night. It is thought that many, many years ago, the tree was brought from Africa.

The King looked at the young tree and then at his son. “Just as you will be king some day, this young tree will grow to bear the king of fruits — the mango! Wait for some time and you will get to taste a fruit like none other.”",22,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"Mango

Who doesn't love delicious mangoes! They are equally tasty, whether they are ripe and golden or green and sour when they are raw and eaten with a bit of salt. We all wait eagerly for the summer season when the mango fruit ripens. It has been rightly called the king of fruits

in India.

There are many types of mangoes. Some are big and yellow and can weigh almost a kilogram; others are tiny, green and juicy and have to be sucked to be really enjoyed.

You can throw a whole lot of mangoes in a bucket of ice water and when they are cool, sit under a tree and enjoy them. It is a good practice to wear old clothes and eat mangoes because their juice can ruin clothes.

In India, we have more than a thousand different varieties of mangoes. Wild mango trees originally grew in the Himalayan foothills and spread from there to the rest of the world. The mango tree is about 15 metres tall. Old trees can sometimes grow up to 30 metres. Some mango trees in orchards are just about three metres tall.",23,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"The trunk is a dark brown and the long leaves are pointed at the tips. The crushed leaves have a sharp scent. The mango flowers at the end of the cold weather. The bunches of the little pale yellow flowers have a sweet smell. Honey bees gather nectar from them.

Mango leaves are strung on a thread and hung over a doorway, when there is a wedding or any other ceremonial celebration in Hindu households. The motif of a mango can also be found in Indian textiles, saris and various Indian handicrafts. Mango leaves, seeds and flowers are all used for medicine. Mango has lots of vitamin C, which helps us to fight off colds, coughs and gives us healthy gums. Vitamins A and B are also found in this fruit.

After admiring the trees for a while the King and his son headed back to the palace. The prince turned back. He smiled and thought to himself, 'Yes, I like our orchard and all its trees, just like father. I will soon grow to be a king and you will too,' and waved to the young swaying mango tree.",24,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"Green Gyan

Trees are the tallest of all plants in the world and they were present on the earth much before human beings appeared.

Trees grow on mountains, along seashores and in hot deserts. We find them growing along the edges of roads, in fields and in our homes and gardens. All plants and trees are necessary for life on earth as they provide oxygen that living beings need to survive.

Most plants have a green colouring matter in their leaves called chlorophyll. During the day, when sunlight falls on the leaves, the leaves prepare food for the plants by a process called photosynthesis. They do this with the help of the water absorbed by the roots, the carbon dioxide from the air that enters the leaves through tiny pores on the surface of the leaf, and sunlight. Oxygen is let out into the air as a result of photosynthesis.",25,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb
"There are thousands of different types of trees but the ones that give us delicious fruit are the best of them all. All trees bear fruit. However, all fruits are not edible. Some may even be poisonous!

But trees are our special friends. They give us shade on a hot day; they provide us with food, timber and medicines. When trees grow over a large area, they form forests. Forests affect the climate of a place, prevent soil erosion and provide a habitat for a variety of animals.

We must look after trees and plant trees if we can, so that we have a healthy environment.",26,CC-BY,Nimret Handa,,en,0039_a-walk-among-trees.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0039,pb

FIND OUT MORE!

Where does thunder come from?

Everything around us is made up of tiny particles called atoms. Each atom has a nucleus at the centre, which is filled with particles called neutrons and positively charged particles called protons. Even tinier particles (negatively charged) called electrons go around the nucleus like the planets go around the sun.

In a thundercloud, air carries bits of ice and water droplets upwards. When they rub against each other, the atoms in them become ions (that is, they become charged positively or negatively). The positive ions are lighter and move upwards, while the heavier negative ions move downwards to the bottom of the cloud.

The negative ions at the bottom of the cloud attract the positive ions on the earth. When they start flowing towards each other, electricity is created, which becomes a huge, powerful flash of lightning.

The lightning makes the air around it very, very hot almost as hot as the sun! This hot air expands very quickly, causing a big explosion. It then begins to contract equally quickly once the lightning flash has passed. This explosion of air is what causes the sound waves that we call thunder.

Try this experiment!

To understand how particles with opposite charges attract each other, let's make a magic ‘magnetic balloon'!

You need:

A balloon

A piece of wool or silk

A wall

What to do:

1. Blow up the balloon.

2. Rub it briskly with the piece of wool or silk.

3. Hold it against the wall and watch it ‘stick' there like a magnet to iron!

Why does this happen?

When you rub the balloon with the wool or silk, electrons get transferred between the two. The atoms in the balloon take in more electrons, so the balloon becomes negatively charged. When you hold it against the wall, the negative ions in the balloon get attracted to the positive ions in the wall, causing the balloon to stick to the wall!",14,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0040_sister-sister-where-does-thunder-come-from.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0040,pb

FIND OUT MORE!

Why is the sky blue?

Sunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. The gas molecules in the atmosphere interact with the sunlight before it reaches our eyes.

Each ‘colour' of light is actually a different wavelength of electromagnetic radiation. Different wavelengths not only make up different colours, they also behave differently. Each of the different wavelengths in sunlight (or, in other words, each of the colours that sunlight is made up of) interacts differently with the molecules in the atmosphere.

When sunlight strikes the molecules, they scatter the blue light (which has a shorter wavelength) more than they do the red, orange, yellow and green lights (which have longer wavelengths). Since the blue portion is scattered more, the sky appears blue.

Try this experiment!

Why does the sky appear orange and red at dawn and dusk?

Let's try this exercise to find out.

You need:

A clear glass full of water

A little milk

A torch

What to do:

Shine the torch on the glass of water. Can you see the light in the water? Hardly. Now add a few drops of milk into the water. Then shine the torch again on the glass. This time, you will notice that the light is more visible. Add a few more drops of milk. Now you will notice that the light in the glass is distinctly blue.

Why does this happen?

When you add the first few drops of milk to

the water, the number of molecules in the

water increases. The fat and protein molecules in the milk scatter the light so that we can see it. When you increase the number of molecules by adding more milk, the light is scattered more, especially the blue light, which has a shorter wavelength.",17,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0042_sister-sister-why-is-the-sky-so-blue.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0042,pb

Why don't things fall up?

About 350 years ago, a famous English scientist called Isaac Newton was relaxing under an apple tree when an apple fell and hit him SMACK! on the head. Rubbing his sore head, Newton wondered why things never fell up. Finally, he came up with the theory that the earth was like a giant magnet, which attracted everything around it with great force. He called this invisible force ‘gravity'.

He also concluded that everything in the universe attracts everything else. Bigger objects attract each other with greater force than smaller ones. Also, as the distance between two objects increases, the force of attraction between them decreases.

Gravity, however, does not just make apples fall down from trees. It also keeps the moon in orbit around the earth and all the planets in orbit around the sun. The force of the earth's gravity keeps the moon from flying away into space.

But why doesn't the moon fall towards the earth? Because the moon has its own gravity, with which it attracts the earth. It is because the earth's gravity is greater, that the moon goes around the earth. If the moon's was greater, the earth would have gone around the moon instead!

Try this experiment!

You need:

A few rubber bands

A small rubber ball

A length of string

What to do:

Put the rubber bands around the ball in such a way that they grip it tightly. Tie the string to one of the rubber bands around the ball. Stand somewhere where there is plenty of room and swing the ball around your head. If you swing it hard enough, the ball will go around your head in a horizontal circle. Now let go of the string. What happens? The ball flies away in a straight line.

Why does this happen?

Because there is a tension force in the string, which keeps the ball turning around your head. When you let go of the string, the tension force disappears and the ball goes flying.

Now imagine the ball is the moon and you are the earth. The earth's gravity is like the tension force in the string! If this tension force did not exist, the moon would fly away into space!",15,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0043_sister-sister-why-don-t-things-fall-up.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0043,pb

"What is a Collage?

Each of the pictures that you have seen in this book is a collage (pronounced ko–laaj). Collage is a way of making a whole new picture by putting bits of material together. The material could be handmade and printed paper, like in this book. It could be clippings from newspapers and magazines, old greeting cards, photographs, fabric, ribbons, dried flowers and leaves, or anything else that you find lying around!

The word “collage” comes from the French word “colle” meaning “glue”. To make a collage, you need bits of different material, a scissor or a pair of nimble fingers to tear up stuff and lots of glue to stick things together. This page shows the four elements, Wind, Water, Earth and a fiery Sun, and uses bits from paper you can spot in the book.

"Basava and his sister Sundari sat on the sand watching the sun rise over the sea. Slowly, the sky turned from grey to blue and the edges of the clouds became an orange colour. They sat staring at the horizon – that line in the distance where the bowl of the sky seemed to curve down to meet the sea.

Their father was a sailor who had sailed away on a merchant ship many months ago. The children were eagerly waiting for him to come back home. So, every morning at sunrise, they came and waited by the beach hoping to see the tall red sails of their father's ship rise slowly above the horizon. The children had seen many ships come and go because they lived in Mamallapuram, which was a busy port. The ships came from many distant lands carrying exciting cargo – chests of silk and pottery, jars full of wine, perfumes and even horses. Their father's ship had sailed out carrying logs of cedar and sandalwood, and bags of spices, rice and ghee.

“It's been so many months,” Sundari said sadly, “Appa has never been away for so long.”

“Remember that big storm last week?” Basava added worriedly, “The sea was full of high waves. I hope Appa's ship is safe.”",0,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0058_sailing-home.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0058,pb
"“Look, a ship is coming!” said Sundari excitedly, “But I can't see the sails.” As they watched eagerly, a ship appeared on the horizon. It was a small dot that slowly grew larger as it came closer. First, they saw the sails filling out with the wind. Then the high masts and the wooden bow rose into view.

“No,” said Basava, disappointed, “Appa's ship has red sails with a flying eagle painted on them. This one has black and green sails.”

They felt disappointed and decided to go home. They had work to do — they had to help their mother at her vegetable stall in the market. Their father was often away from home and after a while all the money he left behind would get over. That is why their mother sold vegetables, so that they had enough to eat.

Sundari enjoyed working at the vegetable stall. The market was such an interesting place! Often their customers were sailors from different lands – some with pale skins and narrow tilted eyes and some with dark skins and curly hair. They wore odd clothes and jewellery and spoke in languages Sundari could not understand at all!",1,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0058_sailing-home.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0058,pb
"This morning, as Basava was laying out bundles of spinach and cabbage, one of their regular customers came to buy vegetables. She was the wife of a trader who often sent spices to other lands by ship. She knew all about the ships coming and going from Mamallapuram.

As she picked through the radishes and beans, the trader's wife asked, “Any news of your father?”

Sundari shook her head sadly. “Why don't you go and ask at the jetty where all the ships are anchored?” she said.

“Ask what?” Basava leaned forward eagerly.

“Ask the sailors if they have seen your father's ship on their way to Mamallapuram. My husband does that quite often when his ships are late.” That afternoon, the children headed towards the main jetty. They went through the market and took the street going towards the sea. They went past the warehouses where the merchants kept the goods meant to be loaded into ships.

In one warehouse, labourers were unloading bags of pepper and coriander seeds. In another, they were stacking up bales of cotton cloth woven in bright colours.",2,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0058_sailing-home.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0058,pb
"Three ships stood anchored at the jetty, tied to the shore by thick ropes. Two more ships were waiting out at sea. Small boats were moving in and out among them with the boatmen selling everything from flowers and fruits to beads and woodcarvings. Among the ships anchored at the jetty was the ship with the black and green sails that they had seen in the morning.

They went towards a ship that was being loaded with goods. As they neared it, a soldier carrying a spear stopped them. “Halt! Watch where you are going!” the man yelled. “No one is allowed on this ship without a royal permit.”

“Permit?” Sundari looked puzzled. “Why?”

“Because it is a royal ship, you silly girl!”

“You mean this ship belongs to the royal navy?” Basava's eyes widened in surprise. “Are we going to war?”

“Of course not! This is a trading ship. His Majesty King Narasimha Varman owns many ships that trade with far off kingdoms. This one is going to the port of Tamralipti in the north.”

“We are looking for a ship that has come from the kingdom of Kamboja...” Sundari began hesitantly.",3,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0058_sailing-home.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0058,pb
"“Our father is a sailor and he sailed for Kamboja many months ago. We want to ask the sailors if they have seen his ship.”

“Kamboja?” the soldier asked. He then pointed to the ship with the black and green sails and said, “That ship's arrived from there.”

Basava and Sundari ran to the ship, up the gangplank and on to its deck. They stopped when they saw that all the sailors on board were foreigners. They were speaking to each other in a strange tongue!

“Oh no!” Basava sighed. “How do we make them understand us?”

“Easy!” Sundari grinned. “We talk to them like Amma does when they come to buy vegetables.”

“Of course!” laughed Basava, “We act and make signs with our hands.”

They looked around trying to spot a sailor with a friendly face. Finally, they went up to a sailor sitting on a roll of rope.

He was an old man with a dark, leathery, sunburnt face. There were deep lines around his narrow eyes. He wore loose pyjamas, a sleeveless jacket, bright bangles and earrings.

“Kamboja?” Sundari asked nervously. The man nodded happily, “Kamboja!”

Basava pointed to the sail, then he pointed to the red skirt Sundari was wearing and said, “Ship? Red sail?”

The man frowned and shook his head. Sundari tried to explain. She tapped the side of the ship and said, “Ship?” Then she pointed to the sails and to her skirt, “Sail? Red?” The man pointed to the sea and said something in his own language.

“Yes! A ship with red sails. Have you seen it?” Sundari asked excitedly. The man looked a bit puzzled.

“Our father... Appa!” Sundari was acting out a tall man with a moustache.

“Oh!” The man then flapped his arms to mimic a bird flying.

“YES!” the children jumped and yelled in delight, “A flying eagle is on the sail!”

The man was laughing as he stood up and pulled them by their hands to the other end of the ship. Then he pointed to the horizon where a ship was slowly sailing towards them, its red sails blowing proudly in the breeze.

Basava and Sundari were speechless! There, before their eyes, were the familiar high masts, the curving prow, the red sails with flying eagles...

“Your Appa is a sailor?” the man asked gently, looking at their delighted faces. “Is he on that ship?”

“Oh!” The children stared at him in disbelief.

“You can speak our language!” Sundari exclaimed.

“A little bit,” the man laughed. “I come to Mamallapuram often. But I did enjoy your acting, especially ‘the tall man with the moustache' part!”

Basava and Sundari taught their sailor-friend many new words as they stood at the jetty, waiting happily for the ship to come home.",4,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0058_sailing-home.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0058,pb

"Story notes
Ju|'hoan storyteller, Nxisae Magdaline Nxao, told a short version of
this story in Dkar, Botswana, in 2005 (Winberg 2009). In 1993,
Sigrid Schmidt recorded another version from Paulina Oxoros in
northern Namibia (Schmidt 2007: 59). This particular version was
retold by Marlene Winberg in 2013 for the Cave to Cave European
Union storytelling project in Spain, based on Nxao and Schmidt's
recording. The 'clever little girl' belongs to a well-known story type
where a vulnerable young girl (or young boy), saves the lives of
others, by engaging her wit and the power of words, rather than
supernatural means to solve problems.
The illustrations in this story are from story boards by Marlene
Winberg, interpreted digitally by Satsiri Winberg through
manipulations of the Manyeka Art Collection of paintings made by
San artists.",15,CC-BY,Traditional San story,,en,0070_katitu-momambo-the-clever-little-girl.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0070,asp

"This is the story of Ngede, the Honeyguide, and a greedy young man named Gingile.

One day while Gingile was out hunting he heard the call of Ngede. Gingile's mouth began to water at the thought of honey. He stopped and listened carefully, searching until he saw the bird in the branches above his head.

""Chitik-chitik-chitik,"" the little bird rattled, as he flew to the next tree, and the next.

""Chitik, chitik, chitik,"" he called, stopping from time to time to be sure that Gingile followed.",0,CC-BY,Zulu folktale,,en,0072_the-honeyguides-revenge.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0072,asp
"After half an hour, they reached a huge wild fig tree.

Ngede hopped about madly among the branches. He then settled on one branch and cocked his head at Gingile as if to say, ""Here it is! Come now! What is taking you so long?""

Gingile couldn't see any bees from under the tree, but he trusted Ngede.",1,CC-BY,Zulu folktale,,en,0072_the-honeyguides-revenge.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0072,asp
"So Gingile put down his hunting spear under the tree, gathered some dry twigs and made a small fire.

When the fire was burning well, he put a long dry stick into the heart of the fire. This wood was especially known to make lots of smoke while it burned.

He began climbing, holding the cool end of the smoking stick in his teeth.",2,CC-BY,Zulu folktale,,en,0072_the-honeyguides-revenge.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0072,asp
"Soon he could hear the loud buzzing of the busy bees. They were coming in and out of a hollow in the tree trunk – their hive.

When Gingile reached the hive he pushed the smoking end of the stick into the hollow.

The bees came rushing out, angry and mean. They flew away because they didn't like the smoke – but not before they had given Gingile some painful stings!",3,CC-BY,Zulu folktale,,en,0072_the-honeyguides-revenge.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0072,asp
"When the bees were out, Gingile pushed his hands into the nest. He took out handfuls of the heavy comb, dripping with rich honey and full of fat, white grubs.

He put the comb carefully in the pouch he carried on his shoulder, and started to climb down the tree.",4,CC-BY,Zulu folktale,,en,0072_the-honeyguides-revenge.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0072,asp
"Ngede eagerly watched everything that Gingile was doing. He was waiting for him to leave a fat piece of honeycomb as a thank-you offering to the Honeyguide.

Ngede flittered from branch to branch, closer and closer to the ground. Finally Gingile reached the bottom of the tree.

Ngede perched on a rock near the boy and waited for his reward.",5,CC-BY,Zulu folktale,,en,0072_the-honeyguides-revenge.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0072,asp
"But, Gingile put out the fire, picked up his spear and started walking home, ignoring the bird.

Ngede called out angrily, ""VIC-torr! VIC-torrr!""

Gingile stopped, stared at the little bird and laughed aloud. ""You want some honey, do you, my friend? Ha! But I did all the work, and got all the stings. Why should I share any of this lovely honey with you?"" Then he walked off.

Ngede was furious! This was no way to treat him! But he would get his revenge.",6,CC-BY,Zulu folktale,,en,0072_the-honeyguides-revenge.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0072,asp
"One day several weeks later Gingile again heard the honey call of Ngede. He remembered the delicious honey, and eagerly followed the bird once again.

After leading Gingile along the edge of the forest, Ngede stopped to rest in a great umbrella thorn. ""Ahh,"" thought Gingile. ""The hive must be in this tree."" He quickly made his small fire and began to climb, the smoking branch in his teeth. Ngede sat and watched.",7,CC-BY,Zulu folktale,,en,0072_the-honeyguides-revenge.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0072,asp
"Gingile climbed, wondering why he didn't hear the usual buzzing. ""Perhaps the hive is deep in the tree,"" he thought to himself. He pulled himself up another branch. But instead of the hive, he was staring into the face of a leopard!

Leopard was very angry at having her sleep so rudely interrupted. She narrowed her eyes, opened her mouth to reveal her very large and very sharp teeth.",8,CC-BY,Zulu folktale,,en,0072_the-honeyguides-revenge.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0072,asp
"Before Leopard could take a swipe at Gingile, he rushed down the tree.

In his hurry he missed a branch, and landed with a heavy thud on the ground twisting his ankle. He hobbled off as fast as he could. Luckily for him, Leopard was still too sleepy to chase him. Ngede, the Honeyguide, had his revenge.

And Gingile learned his lesson.",9,CC-BY,Zulu folktale,,en,0072_the-honeyguides-revenge.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0072,asp

"This is the story of a nine-year old giant called Paplu. He was very different from the other giants. They loved to fight, whereas Paplu hated fighting. While his classmates would spend their time twisting the ears of dinosaurs or yanking the tails of tigers, Paplu would be busy protecting his friends.

Paplu's mother was worried about her son. One night she woke up Paplu. “Son, you will never be happy staying in our tribe. I am taking you to a village where people are normal human beings. You will stay there with Raghav, the head man.”

Just before they reached the village, Paplu's mother asked him to close his eyes. When he opened them, he almost fainted. He had shrunk to one-tenth his size and so had she. Paplu's mother handed him over to Raghav and left.",0,CC-BY,Ramendra Kumar,,en,0076_paplu-the-giant.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0076,pb
"Paplu soon made friends with the boys and girls of the village.

One day Raghav came home very worried.

“A ruthless bandit called Angaar has blocked the only way out of our village. We cannot go to our farms to work and will surely starve,” he said. Paplu wished he could help Raghav in some way.

Paplu suddenly remembered something. Before leaving the forest, his mother had told him the magic words which would make him a giant once again. And as a giant, he would easily be able to take care of Angaar.

Paplu did everything he could, including standing on his head and pulling his own ears, but he couldn't remember those words.",1,CC-BY,Ramendra Kumar,,en,0076_paplu-the-giant.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0076,pb
"Then Paplu heard a soft lisp. “Paplu paiyaa, play with me, pleath.”

It was his two-year old neighbour Soni. Paplu was her best friend. He picked her up and threw her high in the air and she started singing:

“Paplu paiyya, Paplu paiyaa thlow me up, cath me quick, Paplu paiyya, Paplu paiyya please show me youll magic thlik.”

Paplu froze! These words and the tune sounded very familiar. He rushed inside and came out with a blue stone in his hand.

He now remembered what his mother had told him, “Son, throw the stone in the air and say these words: I'll throw you up, I'll catch you quick. Don't forget my magic trick.”",2,CC-BY,Ramendra Kumar,,en,0076_paplu-the-giant.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0076,pb
"As Paplu threw the stone and recited the words, he felt himself swelling up like a balloon.

Suddenly he heard a sound – R-r-rip! R-ri-ip!! His clothes were tearing. If he didn't look for cover, he would soon be standing bang in the middle of the village, in clothes hundred sizes too small for him.

All he would have to cover his modesty would be strips of cloth and little else. Paplu rushed into the woods with the sound ‘R-r-rip! Rri-i-p!' chasing him. Once deep into the undergrowth, Paplu got down on his knees.

It looked like he had missed a word or two in the magic chant his mother had made him learn. That is why his clothes had not grown along with his body!",3,CC-BY,Ramendra Kumar,,en,0076_paplu-the-giant.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0076,pb
"What was he to do now? Although he had become a giant, he couldn't venture out on his rescue mission in his birthday suit. He needed clothes urgently. But how was he to get clothes his size and that too, quickly?

He heard a voice and looked down. It was Raghav. “Soni told me you had become big and that you had run away somewhere. When I heard this strange story, I came out to investigate.”

“Using a magic trick my mother taught me, I have become a giant. Now I can take care of Angaar and his gang,” said Paplu.

“That's great, then what are you waiting for?”

“My clothes didn't keep pace with my growth. I am wearing almost nothing. How can I come out like this?” Raghav thought for some time and said, “Okay, give me some time. By nightfall, I'll have your clothes ready.”",4,CC-BY,Ramendra Kumar,,en,0076_paplu-the-giant.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0076,pb
"Raghav went back home and summoned all the tailors in the village. Twenty one tailors appeared in no time. Raghav explained the problem to them and said, “I want a pair of pyjamas and a kurta, to be stitched as soon as possible for Paplu.”

Soon ‘Operation Paplu Dress' started. It was quite funny to see the tailors scrambling up Paplu's back, legs and hands to take his measurements. The whole village got into action contributing whatever material they could. Even Soni donated her doll's shawl to the project!

In seven hours, the dress was ready. In seven hours, with a whoop of joy, Paplu stood up towering over the villagers. He looked really smart with the multi-coloured kurta and an equally multi-coloured pyjama. There was thunderous applause.",5,CC-BY,Ramendra Kumar,,en,0076_paplu-the-giant.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0076,pb
"It was just past midnight. Angaar and his men were fast asleep. Only two bandits were on guard. Suddenly Angaar woke up. He could hear a strange sound. He got up and picking up his sword, rushed out of his tent. The other dacoits too were coming out of their enclosures, spears and swords in hand.

“Whoosh!” There was the sound again. It seemed to be growing louder and closer. “WHOOSH!”

Angaar looked around. A dust storm seemed to be gathering momentum.

Trees had started swaying and the noise was slowly becoming deafening.

“WHOOSH! WHOOSH!” Angaar felt himself being picked up by the air current. He desperately tried to hold on, flaying his arms and legs, but it was no use. He was flying in the air.

To his left, was his deputy Jarnail looking like an ungainly dinosaur. To his right, was his most accomplished swordsman, Talwar, air-borne like his colleagues, desperately trying to reach out for his sword which was flying ahead of him. A few minutes later, there was a splash.",6,CC-BY,Ramendra Kumar,,en,0076_paplu-the-giant.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0076,pb
"They landed in the river to the south of the village. As they swam to the shore, spluttering and shivering, a huge shadow loomed over their heads.

“Angaar, you scoundrel!” the shadow thundered, its voice echoing in the night.

“Y...yes,” stammered the dreaded Angaar. He had never been so terrified in his life, since the day his father, Rosh Bundela had walloped him for eating up his jalebis.

“This time I have merely roughed you up. Next time, if you or any of your men come anywhere close to the village, I'll rip each and every limb from your bodies and chew them up.”

“Y..yes, Maharaj, we will never again come within a thousand miles of this place.”",7,CC-BY,Ramendra Kumar,,en,0076_paplu-the-giant.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0076,pb
"“Good. Remember, if I hear you are even passing through these parts, I'll make a paste of you and your gang and feed it to the fish in this river.”

“Yes, Maharaj. But please, do tell me, who are you? I have never seen you in these parts.”

“I am a guardian of this village,” Paplu said. He paused for a good ten seconds and then in his deepest tone said, “And my name is Paplu, the Giant.”

And with these words, Paplu stormed back to the village. Angaar and his men left the same night and were never heard of again.

Paplu went back to his original shape and size. However, he couldn't get back his original name. No one called him Paplu anymore. To everyone, and even to Soni, he was Paplu, the Giant.",8,CC-BY,Ramendra Kumar,,en,0076_paplu-the-giant.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0076,pb

"“Kallu get up! You'll get late for school again! KALLOOO!”

The urgent voice pierced through a lovely dream in which Kallu and his friend Damu were catching a huge fish in the river, and for some strange reason the fish was smiling at them.

Kallu pushed a bleary face out of his quilt and protested sleepily, “Shabbo it's too early! I hardly slept!”

“No, it isn't,” his brother Shabbo said firmly. “The sun came up long ago. Ammi has already milked the buffalo and we've all had breakfast.”

Kallu sat up shivering and looked out of the window and mumbled, “Sun? I don't see any sun.”

“That's the mist you idiot! Abbu has already gone to work in the vegetable field and all the school kids of our mohalla went past long ago.”

“Everyone's gone?” Kallu about to yawn swallowed it in panic. “Even Munia?” Shabbo nodded silently, his face looking really gloomy.

“BAAP RE!”

Throwing back the quilt, Kallu struggled out of bed. He couldn't get late for school again! He just couldn't! Two days earlier, Masterji had threatened that one more late entrance in class and the punishment would get really serious. He was even thinking of not promoting him to the next class. And that too after he made Kallu stand in a corner holding his ears for hours and hours.

“I have to think up a story right now!” Kallu thought desperately as he hunted for his chappals under the bed. “A really wonderful, heartbreaking, very convincing story...”

He rushed at super speed to get ready, like he did every morning. He quickly splashed some freezing water on his face to really open his eyes, no bath of course.

Luckily it was winter or his mother would have made him take one. He grabbed a shirt, trousers and sweater and hopped about putting them on. Shoving his feet into his chappals, he looked at his younger brother and panted, “You're so lucky Shabbo! No school for a whole month!”

Shabbo sitting by the window, his right leg covered in plaster, said grimly, “Sure! Breaking a leg is great fun. I love sitting here all day, getting so bored I could tear out my hair, while you go off with Damu to play football. Zaroor, I'm having fun!”

By the time he finished speaking, Kallu was already out of the house and half way down the lane. Shabbo leaned out of the window to watch his hurrying figure vanish through the swirling mist. Then a huge delighted grin slowly spread across his face.

“He's gone!” Shabbo sang out.

“You can come out Munia!”

His sister Munia who had been hiding behind a cupboard, came out with an even bigger smile on her face. They were laughing so much that Munia got an attack of hiccups.

On his way out, Kallu had grabbed a dry chapati from the kitchen and now taking a bite he mumbled to himself, “A story Kallan Mian! A very convincing, brand new story or you're standing in the corner again.”

Life was a mystery to Kallu. He liked school, he really did. He enjoyed doing sums and learning science, he loved playing football and singing in the school programmes. But then why, oh why, did he find it so hard to get to school on time? Even Masterji couldn't really understand it.",0,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0079_kallu-s-world-1-in-big-trouble-again.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0079,pb
"He had suggested sarcastically that Kallu should start sleeping in the school veranda at night, and all the other kids in his class had laughed at Kallu.

If Masterji really did not promote him to class nine, then he was in deep trouble because then his Abbu would make him leave school and make him work in the vegetable fields. Who wanted to pull up spinach and collect carrots and peas when he could go to school? School was a hundred times more fun and he knew that if he could pass the twelfth class board exam, he could find a good job, may be even go to college! Going to college... ah! That was Kallu's biggest dream.

What Kallu really wanted to do, was to complete his twelfth class and then learn about computers.",1,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0079_kallu-s-world-1-in-big-trouble-again.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0079,pb
"Masterji said he had the brains to do that. Last month, he had taken their class to a computer show in the nearby town and they all thought the machines were totally amazing! The salesman had shown him the correct way to use the mouse and how you could go into the Internet. That was absolute magic! Now Kallu and Damu wanted to become magicians with the mouse, going zip-zap across the computer screen.

On the way back in the bus, he and Damu had worked out a fantastic plan. Now that the new highway went past Khajuria village, they would open a dhaba-cum-STD booth-cum-computer centre right beside it. Damu, who dreamed of food all the time would run the dhaba, and Kallu would manage the STD booth.

Truck drivers would eat at the dhaba and call home from the STD booth and the people from all the nearby villages sending vegetables, wheat and sugarcane to the wholesale market, could check out the latest market prices on the Internet.

“Kya baat! ‘Damodar Dhaba and Kallan Computer Centre'.” Damu smiled and then turned to give Kallu an anxious glance, “If only you would get to school on time.”

Whizzing past the tea shop, still munching the chapati, Kallu yelled, “Salaam Dharam Chacha!”

Dharampal, the chai shop owner, looked up from the boiling kettle and gave a surprised look, “Arrey it's Kallu!” Then his grin widened as his eyebrows shot up, “What's the matter? Did the sun rise from the west today? Where are you going so early in the morning?”
“Schooooool!”

“Have a pakora first!” And he laughed. “Garam garam Dharam ke pakorey!”

Hurrying along Kallu had no time to reply. Dharampal Chacha jokes about everything, he grumbled to himself. Here Kallu was in serious trouble and he was talking about silly pakoras. What was so funny about Kallu getting late for school anyway? It happened every week!",2,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0079_kallu-s-world-1-in-big-trouble-again.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0079,pb
"Of course, the most disastrous was when he arrived late, day before yesterday. There was a rehearsal for the 26th January programme and when he crept into the school courtyard, they were already singing “Jaiya he!” of the National Anthem. And Kallu was supposed to be there in front with Damu, Munia and Saru leading the singing.

So he stood at the back, sang “Jaiya he!” and was trying to sneak off to class when someone grabbed him by the collar and hauled him back.

His heart nearly stopped as he looked up at Masterji's grim face.

“You are again late for rehearsals, so you're out of the show.” Masterji's voice was cold as ice.

“Oh no! Please Masterji!” Kallu had tears in his eyes and these were real tears, not the ones he could bring out at will. He really wanted to be part of the show. “Please... please...” he pleaded desperately. “I promise I won't be late again.”

“Fine.” Masterji's voice softened a bit. “I'll let you go this time, but one more late mark and you're out! Get that?” Kallu nodded with a sniff. By then they had reached Kallu's classroom and as Kallu headed to his seat, he said, “Where are you going? Stand in the corner, holding your ears.” His classmates had already begun to giggle when Masterji came up with the final, terrible threat, “May be I won't promote you. Kallan - failed in eighth because of late marks!”

And now he was late again. His life was over.

A good story... thought Kallu ...a really credible excuse. He had come up with so many in the past, why couldn't he think of a new one today?

In his mind's eye, he could see Masterji frown in disbelief looking down at Kallu, as he stood stammering and stuttering away. He was concentrating so hard on his story, he ran straight into a herd of buffaloes.

Just my luck, he thought in disgust, dodging the mooing cattle. In a life threatening crisis like this, what do I do? I crash into Badri and his fat buffaloes. Puffing and panting, slithering through the mud, he struggled through. Badri, the mad buffalo man in his huge turban, waved a stick in greeting and smiled behind his bushy moustache.

“Aren't you early Kallu? Why don't you help me wash the buffaloes and then go to school?”

“Are you joking?”
“No. I'll give you five rupees. There's time, you're early.”

“Sure, I'm early,” muttered Kallu irritated. “I'm so early it's not even today yet, it's still yesterday. And I'll also feed your buffaloes and dance with them.”

“Heh! Heh!” Badri laughed as he slapped a buffalo on the rump. “You're really funny Kallan!”

Kallu kept running. The whole village is against me, he thought gloomily, even crazy Badri.",3,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0079_kallu-s-world-1-in-big-trouble-again.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0079,pb
"Can't they stop joking and teasing a poor boy like me? And then he got busy with the story-cum-excuse problem once again.

Ammi was sick and he had to make breakfast? Nope. He'd tried that one at least twice before. It won't work again.

The goat had run away? Nah! It didn't work last time. Someone stole his pen? The pen was right there in his school bag.

His chappals broke and he had to get them repaired? No way! They were brand new.

Going past Damu's house, he saw his best friend and his sister Saru sitting on a charpai in the courtyard, eating breakfast. Ha! They were late too, Kallu thought in triumph, and they are still eating, so they'll come in after me, and hopefully Masterji will be so busy yelling at them, he'll forget about me.

Damu looked up, his eyes wide in surprise, “Oye Kallu! Wait for me yar!”

“Paranthas, Kallu Bhaiya,” Saru called out. “Gobhi paranthas!”

“No time!” Kallu huffed past at full speed. “Meet you in school.”

“Theek hai. See you later.” Damu shrugged and went back to eating.

Damu and Saru are so lucky, Kallu thought. They lived right next to school. They could even leave home when the school bell rang. As he got to the school gate, Kallu's heart began to thud really fast. Guess who was standing there, stuffing a paan into his mouth. Masterji!! Talk of bad luck!

Kallu skated to a stop, and began in a nervous rush, “I'm sorry I'm late Masterji, but today it's not my fault at all! I had to help Shabbo take a bath. You know he's broken his leg and...” he came to a sudden stop because of an amazing sight. Masterji, the scariest human being on earth, was laughing!

“Wait!” Masterji held up a hand, while he tried to stop from choking on his paan. “Why are you telling me a new story today?”

“What story?” Kallu tried hard to look shocked. “I never tell stories... I mean... but...” Things are getting very strange here, thought Kallu. “Every word is hundred percent true, Masterji!”

“You are nearly fifteen minutes early Kallan,” Masterji's smile still lingered.

“EARLY?” Kallu froze in shock. “WHAT DO YOU MEAN EARLY?”

Masterji pointed to his watch, “See? Seven forty five.”
“Munia's not here?”

“No one's here yet.” And Masterji laughed again, sending out a spray of paan juice into the air. “No one except you!”

Kallu stood still, “You mean I could have slept more? I had time for breakfast?” He nodded to himself. “Now I know. It's Shabbo and Munia. I'll kill them. I really will. Just because Shabbo is bored he's played this trick on me.”

""And you wasted a good story too,” Masterji said sympathetically. “Better come in anyway.”

“I'll make Shabbo pay for this,” Kallu said through gritted teeth.

“I really will.”

“What will you do?”

“I'll break his other leg!!” said Kallu with a glare.",4,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0079_kallu-s-world-1-in-big-trouble-again.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0079,pb

"One sunny morning, the woodcutter of Gura set out to get some firewood. He walked across the plain until he came to the great big olive tree by the river.

He climbed the tree and perched himself at the end of the largest branch. Then he made himself comfortable, swung his axe, and began to cut the branch on which he was sitting.

The village priest, who was passing by, looked up at the woodcutter and stopped to talk to him. “Brother, what are you doing?” he cried. “That's no way to chop wood!”

“What other way is there?” answered the woodcutter. “If you want wood, you must lift your axe and keep going chop-chop-chop!""

“But you're sitting at the end of the branch and chopping it in the middle! The branch will break, and when it does, you'll fall down and die,” warned the priest.",0,CC-BY,Veena Seshadri,,en,0082_the-woodcutter-of-gura-a-folktale-from-ethiopia.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0082,pb
"The woodcutter thought the priest was joking. In any case, he was stubborn and lazy, and didn't want to get up and change his position, so the priest shook his head and walked away. And the woodcutter sat exactly where he was, and went chop-chop-chop, once again.",1,CC-BY,Veena Seshadri,,en,0082_the-woodcutter-of-gura-a-folktale-from-ethiopia.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0082,pb
"Suddenly, there was a mighty loud c-r-a-c-k, and down crashed the branch, the man and his axe!

As he lay on the ground, dazed and bewildered and aching everywhere, the woodcutter remembered his conversation with the priest.

“The priest said three things – that the branch would break, that I would fall...and be killed. The priest was right. The branch broke just as he said it would, and I fell too.

The priest is indeed a very wise man, so whatever he says must be true. Ah, me! Then I must be dead!”

It did not take the woodcutter long to convince himself that he was really dead. So he just closed his eyes and lay on the ground without moving. After a while, his friends came along and called out to him, but the woodcutter lay perfectly still. They shook him and splashed water on his faced. But the woodcutter neither spoke nor moved as he had made up his mind that he was quite dead.

They tried to make him stand, but the woodcutter thought to himself, “Surely, a dead man can't stand up!” and promptly fell down again. Now his friends too were convinced that he was dead. So they lifted him up and began to carry him back to the village. “Pick up my axe!” shouted the woodcutter, and they did.

Soon they came to a fork in the path and there they stopped. Should they turn right or left? The friends stood there and began to argue long and loud.",2,CC-BY,Veena Seshadri,,en,0082_the-woodcutter-of-gura-a-folktale-from-ethiopia.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0082,pb

Soon they reached the woodcutter's house, but found no one at home. So they put him on the floor and began to argue about what they should do next.",3,CC-BY,Veena Seshadri,,en,0082_the-woodcutter-of-gura-a-folktale-from-ethiopia.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0082,pb
"“Send for my wife, of course!” the woodcutter cut in angrily.

“Right away, brother! Who would have thought that a dead man could come up with such a clever idea!” marveled his friends, and they promptly sent for his wife. Sobbing and wailing, the woodcutter's wife appeared, and many of the villagers followed her into the house.

“A branch fell on him and killed him,” the friends began to explain.

“No! No! No!” exclaimed the woodcutter, “How many times am I to tell you I was sitting on the branch and it broke?”

“But my husband is talking! How can he be dead! What happened to him?” cried the woodcutter's wife.

“How...when...what.... Woman, it's not respectful to ask the dead all those questions,” said the friends.

“I tell you he isn't dead at all,” said the woodcutter's wife. “Use your brains!”

The woodcutter was getting irritated now. “The wise priest told me the branch would break, and I would surely fall down and die. The branch broke and I fell. The priest was speaking the truth. So I must be dead.”",4,CC-BY,Veena Seshadri,,en,0082_the-woodcutter-of-gura-a-folktale-from-ethiopia.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0082,pb
"“Nonsense! In any case, the priest didn't see you after you fell, so...” began his wife.

“Nag! Nag! Nag!” said the woodcutter getting up from the ground in disgust. He picked up his axe and went out of the house.

“Where are you going?” asked his wife.

“To get some firewood so that you can cook dinner,” he said, walking away.

“What a fine man!” murmured his friends. “Even when he's dead he doesn't forget his duty!”

4. Push the lower end of the sail (the mast, that is) down the middle of the raft, between the 4th and 5th sticks. The mast should stay up straight.

"In Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan, there is a mountain called Ban Pin Shan, meaning ‘one half'. Strange name for an ordinary mountain, you might think.

But take one look at it and you will see why it is called so. It looks like one half of the mountain is missing! Almost as if someone has cut off the top neatly, with a big sword. Before you start to wonder how it got its name, let me tell you the legend behind it.

Long, long ago, when Ban Pin Shan was still a whole mountain, there used to be a village near it. One day, a very old man came to the village carrying a huge pot on his head.

His hair was white as snow, and so was his beard. His face was wrinkled like the old, worn-out clothes he wore. He set the pot down in the village square and opened the lid.",0,CC-BY,Greystroke,,en,0083_three-for-free-a-folktale-from-taiwan.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0083,pb
"The sweet smell of fresh dumplings filled the air.

“Hot dumplings! Fresh, hot dumplings!” he yelled. “One for one cent, two for two cents and three, for FREE!”

Villagers passing by became curious and crowded around this foolish man who was giving away dumplings that looked inviting and smelt absolutely delicious.

“One for one cent, two for two cents and three, for FREE!” yelled the old man again. “Red beans and sesame, and three for free.”

The villagers who had gathered around the old man began whispering to each other. “Must be a trick! Three dumplings for free? How can that be?” they said.

“The most delicious ones, Sir,” said the old man as he handed the first one to Big-Head Wang.

It was as big as an egg. Big-Head Wang popped it into his mouth and went mmmm.... Everyone could see that he was really enjoying the dumpling.

By the time he finished the second one, his stomach was full. But he looked at the old man and said, “If I eat the third one, I don't have to pay. It is not a lie, right?” He wanted to make sure the old man had meant what he said.

“Three for free and that it will be!” said the old man, handing Big-Head Wang the third dumpling, which he promptly stuffed into his mouth. If he could eat it, he wouldn't have to pay anything.",1,CC-BY,Greystroke,,en,0083_three-for-free-a-folktale-from-taiwan.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0083,pb
"The old man kept his word and Big-Head Wang went away happy, his stomach full to bursting.

Soon, everyone wanted three dumplings each. Not a single villager ordered one or two dumplings; everyone wanted only three for free. In a while, the whole pot was wiped clean. Some of the villagers were disappointed as the old man prepared to leave.

“My, my, don't all of you have good appetites,” the old man said as he heaved the empty pot over his head and walked away.

Suddenly, Eagle-Eye Chan, who had just gulped down three free dumplings, cried out, “Look! A part of the mountain is missing!”

“Nonsense!” said the villagers. “Too many dumplings in your tummy have made you think funny!” All of them laughed at Eagle-Eye Chan, who kept staring at the mountain long after the villagers had left.

That evening, everyone was talking about the old man and his delicious dumplings. “He must be a really stupid man to give away three for free!” they said, laughing. “Let's hope he comes every day.”

The next morning, the old man arrived again, carrying his pot of dumplings. He set the pot down again in the village square.

“One for one cent, two for two cents and three, for FREE!” he yelled. “Peanuts and sesame, and three for free.”

This time, the pot was emptied an hour earlier than the previous day. The villagers had eaten up all the dumplings, three apiece. And for free. Quietly, the old man heaved the pot over his head and left, smiling a strange smile.

On the third day, the old man came again. This time, the villagers were waiting for the stupid old man to arrive. Soon, they were trying to eat as many dumplings as possible, for free.

Suddenly, a voice said, “Mister, can I have one dumpling, please?”

Everyone froze! Their mouths hung open with bits of dumpling falling out, as they tried to catch sight of whoever had uttered the words.",2,CC-BY,Greystroke,,en,0083_three-for-free-a-folktale-from-taiwan.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0083,pb
"Now, which idiot would want to pay for ONE dumpling when he could have THREE for FREE? There was pin-drop silence. They saw a young man with a soft face standing in the middle of the crowd, a single cent in his outstretched hand.

The old man spoke. “Young man, didn't you hear me?” he said. “One for one cent, two for two cents and three, for FREE!”

“Yes, I did,” said the young man in a sincere voice. “But I've seen how you've carried this huge pot every day, giving away your dumplings, three for free.

You have not made any money in the last few days and I feel sorry for you. I want to help, but I have only enough money to pay for one dumpling.”

When the villagers heard the young man, their hearts were filled with shame. They hung their heads in silence.

The old man stepped towards the young man and embraced him. “Ha! At last I've found you!” he cried. “I am the mountain god and I choose you to be my pupil. I will teach you all the magic that I know,” he said, as tears flowed down his old, wrinkled face.

The villagers quickly realized that the mountain god had disguised himself as this old man to test them. And to find a kind-hearted soul who could become his pupil.

Then, the mountain god revealed to the utter shock of everyone present that the dumplings they had been eating weren't real dumplings.

They were made from the mud that he had dug out from the mountain.",3,CC-BY,Greystroke,,en,0083_three-for-free-a-folktale-from-taiwan.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0083,pb

And when they turned to look at the mountain, they couldn't believe their eyes! There was only half of it left standing! Just as Eagle-Eye Chan had said. But they had been too greedy to listen....

Soon, the mountain god took his young disciple with him to the mountain to teach him the magic of the gods. As for the villagers, their hearts were filled with remorse and they cursed themselves for being so greedy. They named the mountain Ban Pin Sghan – a name that stands to this day – and vowed to be less greedy.

"Once upon a time, in a little village on the banks of the Irrawaddy river, there lived a young woman called Thuza. She was very happily married to handsome young Theingi. But there was one problem that nagged Thuza – her husband believed he was an alchemist and would spend all his time dreaming about ways to turn dirt into gold.

All day, and for days on end, Theingi spent his time in experiments, searching for a breakthrough. Soon, all their money was over, and young Thuza had to struggle to buy food for the two of them. She became very worried. “You should find a job soon,” she pleaded with her husband. “We cannot continue like this!”

But Theingi wouldn't listen. “I'm on the verge of a breakthrough! Why do I have to work when we will be rich beyond our wildest dreams? We will soon be able to turn all the dirt we find into gold!”

Disheartened, Thuza approached her father, wise old Thet, for a solution. Thet was surprised when he heard that his son-in-law was an alchemist. He thought for a while and asked to see Theingi. Thuza returned home happily that day, for she knew her wise father would have a solution.",0,CC-BY,Greystroke,,en,0089_the-magic-powder-a-folktale-from-myanmar.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0089,pb
"The next day, Theingi arrived at his father-in-law's house, fully prepared for a scolding. He was taken by surprise when Thet took him aside and whispered, “When I was young like you, I was an alchemist too!”

The two of them spent the whole afternoon discussing Theingi's work. Finally, the old man stood up and said, “Why Theingi, you've done everything exactly like I did when I was your age! You are definitely on the verge of a breakthrough! Congratulations! But you seem to be lacking one very important ingredient in your experiments. You will need this when you finally turn dirt to gold. Only recently did I discover this. But I am too old for this task. It requires enormous effort...”

“Then let me do it for you, Father!” cried Theingi. He was really excited. All his efforts would pay off at last. “Tell me what the ingredient is!”

“Good, you are excited!” said Thet. He leaned closer and whispered, “Son, the secret ingredient is a silver powder that is found only on banana leaves. You will have to plant the bananas yourself and cast certain spells on them. Then, as the plants grow, the powder on the leaves will gain magical powers.”",1,CC-BY,Greystroke,,en,0089_the-magic-powder-a-folktale-from-myanmar.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0089,pb
"“How much of this powder will we need, Father?” asked Theingi excitedly.

“A kilo,” replied Thet.

“A kilo!” cried Theingi. “That would require hundreds of banana plants!”

“I'm afraid so, Son,” said the old man. “That is why I can't complete the task myself...”

“Don't lose heart, Father!” said Theingi. “I shall!”

Later that evening, the old man taught his son-in-law the magic spells and loaned him the money to start the work.

The very next day, Theingi bought a small field near his home and cleared it. Just as he had been instructed, he dug the ground himself and planted the saplings after carefully chanting the magic spells. Every day he went to the field and examined the saplings. He kept the weeds and pests away diligently. When the plants grew and bore fruit, he carefully collected the silver powder from the leaves and kept it safely in a box.",2,CC-BY,Greystroke,,en,0089_the-magic-powder-a-folktale-from-myanmar.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0089,pb
"There was hardly any powder on each leaf, so Theingi had to buy more land and grow more bananas. But he was determined to do what was needed. It took him several years, but at the end of it all, he had managed to collect enough of the magic powder. He rushed to his father-in-law, excited as never before. He would soon be able to make gold from mere dirt!

“Father, finally... here is the kilo of magic powder!” he cried.

The old man was filled with joy. “Wonderful!'' he said. “Wonderful! You've done well, Theingi. I'm proud of you. Now I will show you how to turn dirt into gold. But first, let's get Thuza. We need her help.” Theingi was a little puzzled, but without losing any time, he ran to his wife and was soon back with her.

“Thuza,” asked the old man, “what did you do with the bananas when your husband was collecting the powder?”

“Why, I sold them, Father,” replied Thuza. “That's how we earned a living.”

“Then you must have been able to save some money too. Theingi grew more than enough bananas...” the old man continued.

“Yes, I did,” replied Thuza.

“Can we see it?” asked Thet.

“Of course, I have kept it safely at home,” beamed Thuza.

The three of them went to Theingi's house where Thuza produced several bags from the loft where she had kept them safely. Thet opened one of the bags, peered inside, and smiled. He then emptied one of the bags on the table. Gold coins tinkled as they fell in a huge, shiny heap. Then he went to the field and came back with a handful of dirt, which he placed next to the heap of gold. “You see, Theingi,” he said, turning to his son-in-law, “you have changed dirt into gold!”

Never after that day did Theingi collect any more magic powder from the leaves. But he continued to grow bananas. His “alchemist” father-in-law had taught him the best way to turn dirt into gold, after all. He didn't need the magic powder any more.",3,CC-BY,Greystroke,,en,0089_the-magic-powder-a-folktale-from-myanmar.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0089,pb

1. Push the toothpick into the banana somewhere along the seam.

2. Without taking it out, carefully rotate the toothpick left and right inside the banana. You should cut all the way through the fruit, but not through the peel, mind you. Also, try and keep the toothpick hole as small as possible – the smaller, the lesser it will be visible.",5,CC-BY,Greystroke,,en,0089_the-magic-powder-a-folktale-from-myanmar.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0089,pb

"It was a very special day and so Raza was wearing his best clothes. Today, he was going to meet someone very important – His Majesty Jalaluddin Akbar, the great Mughal king!

Raza's father Rahmat Khan was an important man too. He was the royal tailor to the king, and he stitched all his angarakhas – the loose coats that the king wore over his tight churidar pyjamas.

This morning they were going to the palace in Fatehpur Sikri with the angarakhas the king had ordered for summer. The king was very fussy about his clothes and it was very hard to please him.

Rahmat Khan had worked hard to make the angarakhas – cutting and stitching late into the night. Raza had helped too – putting in tiny stitches using the finest needle and the best silken thread.

The spring sun shone brightly, the flowers smiled, and the pigeons cooed happily as the two of them walked to the fortress of Fatehpur Sikri. Two soldiers holding spears stood guarding the gate.

“I'm Rahmat Khan,” Raza's father said, “I'm the angarakha maker to His Majesty and I've brought new sets for him.”

“Is His Majesty expecting you?” the guard with big moustaches asked.

“Ji huzoor. He chose the designs himself.”

“Wait here,” the guard turned to go inside, “I'll call the Royal Steward.”",0,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0090_raza-meets-the-king.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0090,pb
"After a while the guard returned with another man. Rahmat bowed to him. “I've brought the summer clothes, Dhaniji,” he said.

“Good! Come with me. His Majesty is still in his sleeping chamber. He'll see you before he leaves for the royal court.”

As they walked in, Raza whispered, “Who is he, Abbu?”

“Dhani Singh. He works in the Khwabgah.”

“Khwabgah?”

“The king's personal palace, where he has his sitting room and bedroom.”

It was a long walk. Raza looked around, his eyes wide with wonder. The Mughal palaces were so beautiful! All made of red sandstone with slim carved pillars and curving arches.

In between were gardens filled with flowers, lily pools and sparkling fountains. Raza thought he was in heaven.

As they waited at the door of the king's bedroom, Raza studied Dhani Singh. Being a tailor's son, he noticed the clothes first.

Dhani Singh was wearing a cotton angarakha in a red and white flowery print over white churidars. His nagra shoes had pointed toes that curved inward. He had tied a narrow cloth belt, a patka, at his waist.

What Raza liked most was his bright red turban, printed with a design in white and yellow squares and dots.",1,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0090_raza-meets-the-king.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0090,pb
"“Your turban is very nice, Dhaniji,” he said, “that's a really pretty design!”

“Thank you! I come from the land of the Rajputs and... this design, called bandhani, is from my homeland.”

As they entered the room, Raza's heart was thudding. Sunlight poured in through the arched doorways, lighting up the thick silken Persian carpet woven in jewelled colours. The room was furnished with a beautifully carved bed and exquisite chairs. There were silk and gold cushions on the low bed. Even the curtains were made of silk!

Raza bowed and then looked at his king. Akbar was choosing jewellery from a box held before him by a servant.

He was not very tall but he had the broad shoulders of a sword-fighter. He had large, slightly slanted eyes, a drooping moustache, and a small mole above his lips.

Hearing them enter, Akbar turned and smiled, “Ah Rahmat! You've brought the angarakhas? And who is this boy with you?”

“My son Raza, huzoor.”

“And can you stitch too, Raza?”

“I'm learning, huzoor,” Raza replied nervously, “but I still make mistakes in cutting the cloth.”

“You'll learn. Your father will teach you,” Akbar said gently.

Rahmat opened the bundle and laid out the angarakhas on the bed.",2,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0090_raza-meets-the-king.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0090,pb
"They were made of the finest muslin and covered with delicate embroidery. All of them were in light summery colours – cream, lemon, pale blue, green and a sparkling white. Raza knew the king's favourite colour was white.

Rahmat helped Akbar put on a white angarakha. Then Dhani Singh brought a large mirror and held it before the king.

“I like the embroidery... and it fits well too,” Akbar said, looking pleased. “Now tie a patka. Let's see how it looks.”

Rahmat took out a handful of belts and tied a light blue one around Akbar's waist, letting the fringed ends hang in front.
“No...” said Akbar moodily, “this is too pale... I want something brighter.”

Raza and his father then tried one patka after another – green and yellow, orange and purple, but nothing pleased Akbar.

“I don't like any of the colours, Rahmat!” Akbar said, frowning impatiently. Raza saw that his father was beginning to look worried. Oh no! If His Majesty did not like the patkas, would he send all the clothes back? “I have to do something fast!” Raza thought.

He looked around and said suddenly, “Huzoor, would you like to try a bright red one with a white and yellow design?”

“What kind of red?” Akbar boomed. “Show me!”

Raza pointed to Dhani Singh's turban, “That red?”

“Hmmm...” Akbar stared thoughtfully at Dhani Singh's moustached face and said, “Let me give it a try.”",3,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0090_raza-meets-the-king.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0090,pb
"In a flash, Raza had taken off Dhani Singh's turban, unrolled it and tied it around Akbar's waist. He waited with bated breath while Akbar studied his reflection in the mirror. He noticed Dhani Singh grinning widely – he must have been amused to see the king wearing his turban as a belt!

“I like the colour... and a new design too!” Akbar said finally.

“Bandhani, huzoor... from the land of the Rajputs,” said Raza promptly.

“Aha! Rajput like my queen, Jodh Bai!” Akbar began to smile. “Dhani, pay Rahmat for the angarakhas and patkas. I'll take them all!”

“Huzoor,” asked Raza cautiously, “Dhaniji needs a turban. We've taken the one he was wearing.”

“Give him a patka!” laughed Akbar. “That boring pale blue one. I am keeping his turban.”",4,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0090_raza-meets-the-king.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0090,pb
"FUN FACTS OF HISTORY

1. Raza lived during the reign of King Akbar over 400 years ago. Akbar was the greatest king of the Mughal dynasty. He was also a famous warrior. He loved wearing clothes with new designs. He also enjoyed flying kites and eating mangoes!

2. Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, was the king of Kabul. He invaded India in 1526 and defeated the Sultan of Delhi, Ibrahim Lodi, at the Battle of Panipat. Akbar was Babur's grandson. He was an equally successful general and never lost a battle during his 49-year rule.

3. Two Mughal kings built new cities. Akbar built Fatehpur Sikri near Agra and Shahjahan built Shahjahanabad in Delhi. Fatehpur Sikri lies empty today but Shahjahanabad (present-day Old Delhi) is full of life and people.",5,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0090_raza-meets-the-king.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0090,pb
"4. Shahjahan's famous Peacock Throne was a square flat seat, with slim pillars at each corner covered with precious jewels. The seat had a canopy, which had the figure of a peacock studded with gems on top of it. The emperor sat under the canopy, leaning against silk cushions.

5. Many Mughal princesses were highly educated. Gulbadan Begum wrote the biography of her father, Babur. Shahjahan's daughter Jahanara was a poet.

6. The Mughal fort had many kitchens. Each kitchen sent food for the king. So when he sat down to eat, he would have as many as thirty dishes to choose from! Lip-smacking Mughlai cusine, which includes yummy dishes like biryani, pulao, kalia and korma, originated in these kitchens.",6,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0090_raza-meets-the-king.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0090,pb

"Dhani knew something exciting was being planned at the ashram, but no one would tell him anything. “Just because I'm nine years old,” thought Dhani glumly. “I'm sure they think I'm stupid. I am not!”

Dhani and his parents lived in a very special place. It was Mahatma Gandhi's Sabarmati Ashram near Ahmedabad where people from all over India came to stay. Like Gandhiji, they were all fighting for India's freedom. During their stay at the ashram, they spent their time spinning khadi thread on charkhas, singing bhajans and listening to Gandhiji's lectures.

At Sabarmati, everyone had to work – cook and clean, wash clothes, fetch water from the well, milk the cows and goats, and grow vegetables. Even Dhani had a job – he had to take care of Binni, one of the ashram's goats. He quite enjoyed that because Binni was his best friend and he liked talking to her.",0,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0093_marching-to-freedom.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0093,pb
"That morning, as Dhani fed Binni with fresh grass and changed the water in her bowl, he said, “Something's up, Binni! They all sit and talk in Gandhiji's room. They are planning something. I know it!”

Binni chewed and nodded as if she understood.

Dhani felt hungry. He headed towards the kitchen, with Binni skipping along beside him. His mother was fanning the chulha, filling up the room with smoke.

“Amma, is Gandhiji going somewhere?” he asked. His mother coughed in the smoke and said, “They are going on a march.”

“March? Where are they going?” Dhani queried.

“Somewhere near the sea. Now stop asking questions and go away Dhani!” his mother said impatiently. “Let me finish the cooking first.”

Dhani wandered off to the vegetable garden where old Binda was digging up potatoes.",1,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0093_marching-to-freedom.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0093,pb
"“Binda chacha,” Dhani sat beside him, “are you going on the march too?”

Binda shook his head. Before he could say anything, Dhani eagerly asked, “Who is marching? Where are they going? What is happening?”

Binda stopped digging and said, “I'll answer all your questions, but first tie up that troublesome goat. She's chewing up my spinach.”

Dhani dragged Binni away and tied her to the lemon tree nearby. Then Binda told him about the march. Gandhiji and some of the men from the ashram were going to walk through Gujarat to reach the sea at a place called Dandi. They would walk through villages and towns for a whole month. Once they reached Dandi, they would make salt.

“Salt?” Dhani sat up and frowned. “Why will they make salt? You can buy it in every shop!”

“I know,” Binda laughed. “But Mahatmaji has a plan. You know he always marches to protest against something, right?”

“Of course I know. He leads the Satyagraha marches to fight the British government and win freedom for India. But why is he protesting about salt? It's silly!”

“It's not silly at all, Dhani! Do you know we all have to pay a tax on salt?”

“So what?”

“Everyone needs salt... that means, every Indian, even the poorest, has to pay this tax,” explained Binda chacha.

“That is really unfair!” Dhani's eyes were hot with anger.

“Of course it's unfair. Not only that, Indians are not allowed to make any salt either. Mahatmaji has asked the British to stop the tax, but they have refused. So he has decided to walk to Dandi and make salt from seawater.”

“Walking for a month!” Dhani brooded worriedly. “Gandhiji will get really tired. Why don't they take a bus or train to Dandi instead?”

“Because, if he goes on this long march and walks all the way to Dandi, the news will spread. There will be pictures in the papers and reports on the radio, and people all over the world will know that we are fighting for our freedom. And that will really embarrass the British.”

“Gandhiji is clever, isn't he?” Dhani's eyes were shining.

“Ah, that he is!” Binda's eyes crinkled with laughter. “He's even written to the Viceroy and told him what he plans to do! The British have no idea what they are in for!”

Later in the morning, Dhani wandered up to the hut where Gandhiji was staying and peered in through a window. Inside, many of the ashram people were talking to Gandhiji. Dhani heard them planning the route along which they would walk to Dandi. He was thrilled to see his father sitting among the people.

In the afternoon, when the ashram was quiet,
Dhani went looking for his father. He found
him under a tree, spinning on his charkha.

“Pitaji, are you and Amma going on the march to Dandi?” Dhani got straight to the point.

“I am going. You and Amma will stay here.”

“I am coming with you.”

“Don't be silly, Dhani. You can't walk so much.
Only the ashram's young men will go.”",2,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0093_marching-to-freedom.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0093,pb
"“I'm nine and I can run faster than you can!”
Dhani replied stubbornly. “You can't stop me
from coming with you.”

His father stopped spinning and explained
patiently, “Only the people who have been
chosen by Mahatmaji will go.”

“Fine! I'll talk to him then! I'm sure he'll say yes,” said Dhani and marched off.

Gandhiji was a very busy man and it was not easy to catch him alone. But Dhani knew exactly when he would have the time to listen – early every morning when he went for a walk around the ashram.

The next morning, as the sun came up, Dhani slipped out of bed and went looking for Gandhiji. He found him in the cowshed checking on all the cows. Then he strolled into the vegetable garden to inspect the peas and cabbage and have a chat with Binda.",3,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0093_marching-to-freedom.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0093,pb
"All the while, Dhani and Binni followed him.

Finally, Gandhiji headed back to his hut. He sat down beside his charkha in the verandah and called out to Dhani, “Come here, child!” Dhani ran up, with Binni skipping along.

“What's your name beta?”

“Dhani, Gandhiji.”

“And this is your goat?”

“Yes, Gandhiji! This is my friend Binni, who gives the milk you drink every morning.” Dhani smiled proudly and said, “I take care of her.”

“Good!” Gandhiji leaned forward. “Now Dhani, tell me why you and Binni have been following
me everywhere this morning?”

“I wanted to ask you something,” Dhani began
nervously. “Can I come with you to Dandi?”

Gandhiji smiled, “You are too small, beta. Dandi
is 385 kilometres away and only young men like your father will be able to walk with me.”

“But you are not young!” Dhani said. “Won't you feel tired?”

“I am a very good walker,” Gandhiji replied.

“I am a good walker too.” Dhani was adamant.

“Ah yes,” Gandhiji looked thoughtful. “But there is a problem. If you go with me, who will take care of Binni? After walking for so long, I will become weak. When I come back, I'll need to drink lots of milk to become strong again.”",4,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0093_marching-to-freedom.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0093,pb
"“Hmm, you're right, Gandhiji. Binni eats only when I feed her.” Dhani lovingly stroked Binni's head, “And only I know what she likes to eat.”

“Exactly! So will you stay in the ashram and take care of Binni for me?”

“Yes, Gandhiji, I will,” said Dhani. “And Binni and I will be waiting for you.”

Fun facts of History

1. In March 1930, Mahatma Gandhi led the march to Dandi to protest against the tax on salt imposed by the British. Gandhi and his followers walked through Gujarat for 24 days. All along the way, they were welcomed with flowers and songs. Newspapers across the world carried reports about the march.

2. At Dandi, Gandhi and his followers collected salt from the seashore and were arrested. The arrest sparked off the Non-cooperation Movement, and people all over India boycotted schools, colleges and offices.

Shobhini asked Nani, “Shall we go to the mela?”

From a distance they could see the big giant wheel. It turned slowly and then faster and faster. “Shall we take a ride on the giant wheel?” Shobhini said to Nani.

The wheel began to move slowly. Then it began to go faster and faster. Shobhini closed her eyes tightly. She was not really scared but felt better when she held on to Nani's hand. She would open her eyes a little from time to time to see where they were. Shobhini noticed that Nani did not shut her eyes. Instead she was laughing and waving to the people below.

When the ride was over, Shobhini and Nani wandered around in the mela. Shobhini bought a little horn. She tooted so hard that a dog jumped up and ran away.",0,CC-BY,Sarvendra Vikram,Rukmini Banerji,en,0095_shobhini-and-nani.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0095,pb

### Shobhini Combs Nani's Hair

Nani had just washed her hair. Her hair was long, soft and white and it was shining in the sunshine. “Nani, can I comb your hair for you?” asked Shobhini. “I will do it carefully. I won't hurt you at all.”

Shobhini combed Nani's hair carefully. She made a parting in the middle and divided her hair into two parts. With each portion she made a pony tail on either side of Nani's head. Not happy with the pony tails, she made them into two long plaits.

Quickly Shobhini found a big yellow flower. She stuck the flower in one of Nani's plaits. A red and orange butterfly came and sat down on Nani's hair. Right next to the big yellow flower. Shobhini ran to bring a mirror.

She showed Nani the two long plaits, the big yellow flower and the colourful butterfly.",1,CC-BY,Sarvendra Vikram,Rukmini Banerji,en,0095_shobhini-and-nani.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0095,pb

“Shall we go to the jungle?” Shobhini asked Nani. “There are wild animals there. You won't be scared, I hope?”

Shobhini and Nani reached the jungle. First they saw a rabbit. He was lost and was looking for his mother. His eyes were full of tears. Shobhini and Nani helped him find his mother.

Elephants were bathing in the river. They filled water in their trunks and sprayed it like a fountain over each other. It looked like a lot of fun.

One monkey was eating a mango on a tree. Shobhini teased the monkey and made a face at him. The monkey was furious. He took a mango and threw it at Shobhini. Nani quickly put her hand out and swiftly caught the mango before it could hit Shobhini. It was a very good catch.

“Be careful of the lightning,” replied Nani.

Shobhini's dog Pillu was under the chair. When he saw Shobhini with an umbrella, he came out from under the chair. Pillu licked Shobhini's hand and wagged his tail.

“All right,” said Shobhini “You can come too.”

Shobhini walked ahead. Pillu was just behind her. As they reached the end of the verandah, there was a sudden gust of wind. Shobhini's umbrella flew out of her hand and out onto the grass. There was a streak of lightning in the sky. Shobhini stopped.",3,CC-BY,Sarvendra Vikram,Rukmini Banerji,en,0095_shobhini-and-nani.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0095,pb

Wool

Nani was sitting in the sun. She was rolling wool into a ball. “Can I help you?” asked Shobhini.

Shobhini looked for the end of the wool. She started rolling it into a ball like Nani was doing. Soon the wool became a big ball. When it was too big, it slipped out of Shobhini's hand and jumped up in the air.

Many swans were flying overhead. One of them caught the ball of wool. Shobhini looked up and saw a long string of red wool hanging from the sky. Shobhini clapped her hands when she saw this sight. The other end of the wool slipped out of her hands.

When the swan heard the clap he looked down. He could see Shobhini on the ground but she looked very small from so high up.",4,CC-BY,Sarvendra Vikram,Rukmini Banerji,en,0095_shobhini-and-nani.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0095,pb

The River

It was a hot summer day. “Nani, will you come with me to the river to bathe?” asked Shobhini.

The river was quite far from the house. Nani and Shobhini sat in a tonga and reached the riverbank. Many people were bathing on the ghats. The water near the banks did not flow very fast. Shobhini had brought many paper boats with her. One of her boats quickly floated away very far. Nani talked to a boatman. Shobhini and Nani sat in the boat and went quite far.

The boatman said, “The water is very deep here. If you put one elephant on top of another, they would both sink.”

‘Wow! One elephant on top of another,' thought Shobhini, entranced. A goldfish leapt out of the water. It touched Shobhini's hand. Shobhini was delighted.",5,CC-BY,Sarvendra Vikram,Rukmini Banerji,en,0095_shobhini-and-nani.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0095,pb

"Story notes
In 2003, Katunga Carimbwe told this version of the Dima and Owl
origin story to Titu Mangumbu and Marlene Winberg in the
Northern Cape Province of South Africa while he was busy painting
on a canvas. Mangumbu, Mahongo and Winberg translated it and
retold the story in this written version with as few alterations as
possible. His elders told the story to him during his childhood in
Mavinga, Angola, where he was born in 1958.
Most of the episodes in the Dima and Owl myth have a wide
distribution in the extensive area of southern Africa and the
Kalahari whose original inhabitants speak !Xun and other closely
related languages, although the names and identities of the
trickster, Dima, and his adversary change from area to area.
The ""clapping game"" mentioned in our version, Dima and Owl, is
still current among the !xun, the Nharo, and possibly other
communities of Kalahari San. This story depicts Dima as a culture
hero and transformer of the primeval world into the present world.
He achieves this with words, ""From now on people will be able to
make a fire with each tree on earth.""

"Khajuria village was suffering from Ramlila fever. It was nothing new, as Kallu said, they got it every year. The fever usually started a month before Dussehra. As the low, dark grey monsoon clouds drifted away and the sky turned a glittering blue, there were festivities in the air and everyone began talking about Masterji and the Ramlila.

Everywhere in the village, at Dharampal's chai shop, in the vegetable fields, at the grocery store, in Moti Dadi's courtyard and at the tube-well, there was a single question being asked.

“What is Masterji planning to do this year?”

Kallu often said admiringly, “Masterji is the producer, director, scriptwriter and music composer of Ramlila and only he knows what we will see this year.”",0,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0109_monkey-business-on-stage-kallu-s-world-2.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0109,pb
"Masterji was the head of the village school and the Khajuria Ramlila Party that put up a fantastic show every year. Of course, they couldn't do the whole Ramayana because that was a very long story, and Khajuria did not have enough actors. So Masterji had written the dialogues of some of the most important scenes, and he would pick a few of them to enact for a week before Dussehra. So Khajuria never knew which scenes they would see.

A tent was put up in a corner of the field where Badri, the milkman kept his buffaloes. A stage was built with a bunch of wobbly folding tables they got from Jai Bhagwan's Tent House. The audience sat on the ground on durries and nowadays, as the village had electricity, they had both gas lamps and electric bulbs to light up the stage.

From the first day, Kallu and his gang were hanging around the school building where rehearsals were held, hoping Masterji would give them something to do. In the gang were Kallu, his sister Munia, brother Shabbo and his best friend Damu and his sister Saru. Day after day, they sat and watched the rehearsals, and by the end they knew most of the dialogues by heart.

Every year, Masterji would select scenes like the Sita swayamvar with Ram breaking the giant bow; then Kaikeyi and Manthara scheming to send Ram into exile and Dasaratha weeping and dying. Munia's favourite scene was of Laxman cutting off Surpanakha's nose and Ravan kidnapping Sita. Then there was Hanuman setting fire to Lanka, and finally the fantastic battle scenes with Ravan, Kumbhakarna and Meghnad fighting Ram, Laxman, Hanuman and their monkey army.",1,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0109_monkey-business-on-stage-kallu-s-world-2.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0109,pb
"This year, their begging had paid off and Masterji had let Kallu, Damu and Shabbo play monkeys in the vanar sena. They were acting in the final battle scene and had to wear shorts, have monkey face make-up and long tails. It was amazing fun as they jumped about waving tin maces and swords. It made the girls, Munia and Saru very envious.

“It's sooo silly!” Saru said grimly as they headed for the school one morning. “Why can't girls act in the Ramlila?”

“Did you see ‘Sita' last night?” Munia asked. “That boy studies in Kallu Bhaiya's class and he's starting to get a moustache...”

“And his voice kept cracking,” Saru giggled. “I really think Billo Chachi would be just perfect as Sita.”

“Yes she would! Now if her husband Dharam Chacha can play Ram, why can't she be Sita?”

“She even asked Masterji, but he said that the Khajuria panchayat would stop the Ramlila if he took real women. Dhat!” Saru shook her head in disgust.

“Anyway, tonight's Badri Bhaiya's big scene!” Munia gave a small skip of happiness. “I can't wait!”

For Kallu and his gang, the best actor in the show was Badri, the mad buffalo man who always played Hanuman. He was short and stocky, had a head of unruly hair, a bushy moustache, big round eyes and a booming voice. So when he was on stage, strutting about yelling out his lines, even Ram and Laxman faded into the background.

According to Kallu and his gang, the scene where Hanuman exchanges insults with Ravan and then sets Lanka on fire was an absolute super-hit scene. Masterji had written such fantastic dialogues for Ravan and Hanuman that the audience was totally hypnotized and listened to every word in breathless silence.

That evening, the gang was among the earliest to arrive at the tent. Badri's buffaloes were tied nearby and according to Damu, they had to do ‘high jumps' over the pats of buffalo dung.

“Second row from the front, middle of the row. Perfect!” said Shabbo, settling down on the durrie with a happy sigh.

“Well, tomorrow we won't need the seats,” said Kallu, giving Munia and Saru a sneaky grin. “We boys will be on stage.”

“Hah!” Munia shook her curly head. “All you do is jump around like idiots, and none of you have a single line to say.”

“And Shabbo will be killed by Meghnad and just lie there flat on his back, like a log of wood,” added Saru with a giggle.

“Do you know it takes real acting to play dead?” Shabbo asked hotly. “I have to breathe very, very slowly and keep my eyes shut tight!”

“You'll get the award for the best dead monkey in Khajuria!” Damu grinned. As the sun set, the tent began to fill up.

Backstage was a hive of activity, with everyone putting on their costumes and slapping on make-up. Dharampal was free tonight, as Ram did not appear in the scene, so he was busy doing the Hanuman make-up on Badri's face.

“I wish you would shave off your moustache Badri,” he said. “It looks really odd. Hanuman on TV and films is always clean-shaven.”

“Colour it brown and no one will know,” growled Badri.

“I am NOT shaving it! FORGET IT!!” Then he held the sheets of dialogue before his face, squinted and grumbled, “Why does Masterji keep changing the dialogues every year?”

“He's an artist and all artists are crazy anyway. This year in the Bharat milap scene, he wanted Ram and Bharat to sing a song,” said Dharampal.

“A song?” repeated Badri.

“Yes. It went - bhai bhai ka pyar amar rahe... something... something...” Dharampal laughed.

“But you can't sing!” said Badri.

“Exactly! And neither can Lattu, who's playing Bharat! He tried for two days to make us sing and then gave up. Thank God!” said Dharampal.

Suddenly, Badri sat up and yelled at the top of his voice, making Dharampal jump, “Masterji! Masterji!”

“Kya hua?” Masterji came running in a panic.

“You wrote a song for Ram but not for Hanuman? And I can sing!” said Badri.

“Arrey Badri!” Masterji stuffed a paan into his mouth, “Hanuman does not sing.”

“And what will you sing anyway?” asked Dharampal carefully painting Badri's nose a bright red.

“Hanuman-Ravan ki dushmani amar rahe?”

“Heh... heh... ho... ho...” Masterji walked away laughing, spraying paan juice in the air.

As Dharampal began to attach the tail to Badri's bright yellow shorts, nobody noticed the thoughtful look on Badri-Hanuman's brown face...",2,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0109_monkey-business-on-stage-kallu-s-world-2.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0109,pb
"An hour later, the curtains were dragged away to reveal Ravan's royal durbar in Lanka, and it looked really gorgeous with carpets, curtains and thrones, all supplied by Jai Bhagwan's tent house. Jai Bhagwan was playing Kumbhakarna because he was the fattest man in the village.

The scene was going beautifully and the audience was absorbed in the action. Ravan was being played by Chhotey Lal, the village wrestler and Mandodari by Narain, who was in class ten, wearing a pink and gold sari.

Ravan looked really threatening with his rippling muscles, bushy eyebrows, curling moustache and big eyes. The only problem was that Chhotey wasn't very good at remembering the dialogues.

“Masterji really struggled to make Chhotey remember his lines,” Damu whispered. “He mixes up everything.”

“And then Masterji solved the problem!” Kallu grinned.

The others turned to look at him, “How?”

“Watch Narain's lips, he's prompting Chhotey.

Masterji made him learn the lines of both Mandodari and Ravan!” whispered Kallu.

“Sooo clever!” breathed Munia in admiration.

“Here he comes!” said Saru with an excited wriggle as Hanuman was dragged on to the stage by the rakshasas. They leaned forward, eyes glued to Hanuman, who was all tied up in thick ropes but stood defiantly tall, glaring angrily at Ravan.

“Who is this?” Mandodari whispered to Chhotey, prompting away.

“Umm...” Ravan bent his head towards her, listened and then said loudly, “Who is this?”

A rakshasa stepped forward, “We caught him in the Ashokavan, Maharaj! He was talking to Devi Sita.”

“What...” prompted Mandodari.

“WHAT!” shouted Ravan springing up, suddenly remembering the rest of his lines, “How did he get inside? What was he doing there?” and he waved his arms in rage.

Munia gave a soft giggle, and then as other people spotted Ravan's face, the rest of the audience also began to laugh. As he was waving his arms, Ravan had dislodged one end of his false moustache, and now it was dangling over his lips like a black earthworm.

From where he sat, Kallu could see Masterji in the wings frantically waving his arms and pointing to Ravan's face. About to start his lines, Hanuman turned to look at the audience in surprise. This was a serious scene. What was making them laugh?

“Kya hua?” he asked, peering into the dark. “Why are you laughing?”

“Ravan's moustache is falling off, Badri Bhaiya!” someone kindly informed him from the back.

“Oh ho! Sorry!” Ravan jumped nervously and quickly fixed the moustache back in place, and then turned a sweaty face towards Mandodari, “What do I say next?” In his panic he forgot to whisper, and everyone began to laugh again.

In the wings, Masterji was chewing his paan faster and faster...

“Tell me who you are... you thieving monkey!” Mandodari prompted.

“What?” Ravan was still a bit flustered. “Theek! Tell me who you are... you thieving monkey!” And he finally turned to address Hanuman, “Where have you come from?”

“Here it comes!” Shabbo leaned forward eagerly, “My favourite dialogue.”

Masterji had written some of the important dialogues in rhyme, and the bit where Hanuman introduces himself to Ravan was the best poetry Shabbo had ever heard. And Badri's acting was always quite superb!

He would stand tall, thump his chest and ask angrily, “Thieving monkey? Who are you to call me that? Do you know who I am?” and then turning to face the audience, he would launch into the poem that Shabbo knew by heart...

Main hooon Ramji ka chela

Main hoon Hanuman albela

Tu hai Ravan balwaan

Kar du tujhko pareshan

Then he would pause dramatically, thump his chest again and say in ringing tones...

Main hoon pavan putra Hanumaaan!

As they waited breathlessly, Hanuman glared at Ravan and shouted, “Do you know who I am?” He turned to face the audience, cleared his throat and suddenly Badri began to sing!

Main hoooon Ramjiii kaaa chelaaa...

“He's SINGING?” Saru's eyes were wide with shock. Main hoon... Hanumaaan... albelaaa... Hanuman sang on...

“He's good!” Kallu was laughing in delight. “Badri Bhaiya can really sing.”

In the wings, Masterji was standing absolutely still, as if struck by lightning. He was staring at his star actor as Badri sang away, and in shock he had forgotten to chew his paan.

Badri sang, eyes raised to the roof and one arm raised like a filmi hero. His tune had a nice rhythm, and the audience began to clap, and even Narain forgot he was on stage and joined in.",3,CC-BY,Subhadra Sen Gupta,,en,0109_monkey-business-on-stage-kallu-s-world-2.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0109,pb
"One rakshasa was swaying his hips in a really funny dance. Badri began to smile, and with a happy shake of his head, he decided to sing the whole song once again!

A snake suddenly slithered past them on the forest floor. “Fetch poles as long and thin as I am,” hissed the snake, so off went Kindru-Lalim and Kincha Lali-Dam to cut bamboos from a nearby grove.",2,CC-BY,Nabanita Deshmukh,,en,0122_first-house.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0122,pb
"As they returned, carrying the bamboo on their backs, they heard a mournful ‘moo'. It was a mithun, a large buffalo-like creature who lives in those areas and she was bending over the carcass of an animal.

“Can you tell us how to build a house please?” asked Kincha Lali-Dam.",3,CC-BY,Nabanita Deshmukh,,en,0122_first-house.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0122,pb
"“I'm much too sad to talk now,” said the mithun sadly, “but I'll help you all the same. You see, a tiger has killed my husband, so make a roof with cross poles, like the bones of his skeleton,” added the mithun, pointing at her dead mate.

Kincha Lali-Dam and Kindru-Lalim thanked the mithun for her advice and began making cross poles out of the bamboo, but they soon began to tire.",4,CC-BY,Nabanita Deshmukh,,en,0122_first-house.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0122,pb
"They put down the bamboo poles and walked to a nearby river to have a drink.

Suddenly, a graceful fish swam up to them and whispered, “I saw from afar that you were building a house! Have a look at the scales on my back. Collect plenty of leaves and put them on the roof, one on top of the other, like my scales. That will protect your house from sun and rain,” said the fish and she gently swam away.",5,CC-BY,Nabanita Deshmukh,,en,0122_first-house.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0122,pb
"Kindru-Lalim and Kincha Lali-Dam now had all the advice they needed to build a house and they worked very hard to complete it. When it was finally done, they called the creatures of the forest to come and have a look.

“What a wonderful house you've built!” cried everyone. “And now it's all yours to live in!”",6,CC-BY,Nabanita Deshmukh,,en,0122_first-house.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0122,pb
"“It's not only ours but yours as well, because you've helped us build it!”cried Kindru-Lalim and Kincha Lali-Dam happily.

The sun shone brightly in the sky, a breeze whistled softly and the trees swayed gently as Kindru-Lalim and Kincha Lali-Dam stepped into their new house. And this is how the first house was built in that faraway land in northeastern India known today as Arunachal Pradesh!

The Singphos

The Singphos live in the Lohit and the Changlang districts of Arunachal Pradesh. Their tribe is divided into a number of clans each ruled by a chief known as Gam. Unlike other hill people who are involved in jhum (shifting) cultivation, the Singphos grow tea.

Singpho women wear bright woollen skirts and black jackets with silver decorations during a festival called Munao Poi. The Singpho men wear colourful lungis with or without a white shirt and cover their heads with turbans.

Singpho houses are usually double storied and made of wood or bamboo. They are oval in shape and the lower storey is used as a stable or for storing food while the upper storey becomes the family's living quarters.",7,CC-BY,Nabanita Deshmukh,,en,0122_first-house.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0122,pb

And now the play!

The Boy and the Drum

Narrator/s (stepping out to one corner of the stage): A poor woman had a son. She worked hard as a gardener in wealthy houses in their town. They gave her some grain in return.

One child mimes the mother, while other children form groups of the well-to-do families. The mother goes to each group and mimes gardening for these groups. Having created this 30-second scene, all the groups, including the mother freeze in their positions.

Narrator: But she felt bad because she could never afford to buy nice clothes or lovely toys for her son.

A young boy comes running through the chorus, singing a song and playing mime cricket. He freezes with a pose at the centre of the stage.

Narrator: The little lad was bright and cheerful. Not having any toys or nice clothes did not bother him. After a hard day's work, the mother was going to the market to sell the grain she had received.

The mother steps towards the boy and the rest of the frozen actors go back to the chorus.

Narrator: She asked her son:

Mother: What can I get for you from the market, little one?",0,CC-BY,Umesh P N,,en,0130_the-boy-and-the-drum.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0130,pb
"Narrator: Now the boy was fascinated with the sound of a drum. So he said:
Boy: A drum, mother, I would love to have a drum to play with.

During the following narration, the boy continues to be frozen in his position while the mother circles the stage. She meets one actor who steps out of the chorus as the merchant to whom she sells the grain, another from whom she buys flour, and on the way she picks up a piece of wood, and goes back to the boy.

Narrator: The mother knew she would never have enough money to buy a drum for her son. She went to the market, sold her grain and bought some gram flour and some salt. While returning home, she felt sad that she would have to face him empty-handed. So when she saw a nice piece of wood on the road, she picked it up and brought it home.

The son did not know what to do with the piece of wood. Yet he happily carried it with him when he went out to play. A happy song sprang to his lips and he went along singing it:

Boy moves around the stage while chorus watches him.

Boy: Tum-ti-tee Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee- Tum-ti-tee- Tum-ti-tee Tot

"Towards the end of the song, an old man emerges from the chorus. He mimes trying to light his stove. As he coughs, the entire chorus coughs, thus amplifying the effect of his condition.

Narrator: And as he went skipping along on his way, he came across an old man. The old man was trying to light his stove using some cow-dung cakes. The fire was not catching and there was smoke all around. The smoke made the man's eyes water and he was coughing. The little boy ran up to him and said:

Boy: What is the matter Grandpa? Can I help you in any way?

Old Man: Ah! Little one, I am trying to cook some food, but I am unable to start a fire.",2,CC-BY,Umesh P N,,en,0130_the-boy-and-the-drum.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0130,pb

Oh! For a dry piece of wood!

Boy: Here, Grandpa, you can use my piece of wood to start your fire.

The following actions are mimed as the narrator speaks.

Narrator: The old man was very pleased. He lit his fire, made some bread and gave a piece to the boy.

The old man steps back into the chorus.

The boy skipped along singing his song:

Boy: La-la-la-la- La-la-la-la- La-la-la-la- LaLa-la-la-la- La-la-la-la- La-la-la-la- La!

La-la-la-la- La-la-la-la- La-la-la-la- LaLa-la-la-la- La-la-la-la- La-la-la-la- La!

Narrator: The boy walked on till he came upon a potter's wife. She had her baby in her arms. The baby was wailing and flailing her arms.

As before, the potter's wife emerges from the chorus, as if with a baby in her arms. While the mother tries to pacify the baby, the chorus hums a lullaby softly. This lullaby can be a regional song.

The boy said:

Boy: Dear lady, why is your daughter crying?

Potter's Wife: My little one is hungry. She has not had anything to eat since morning. I cannot give her anything as there is nothing in the house. I wish I had some bread to give her.

Narrator: The kind hearted boy gave the lady his bread. She gave the bread to her child who ate it eagerly and stopped crying. She was so pleased with the boy that she gave him a large pot.

The above actions are mimed as the narrator voices the lines. After the action, the woman with the baby goes back to the chorus while the boy continues, carrying his pot.

The boy went along humming his funny song:

Boy: Tum-ti-tee Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee-Tum-ti-tee- Tum-ti-tee- Tum-ti-tee Tot

"Narrator: The little boy skipped along until he came upon a strange scene at the river bank.

The chorus can move their hands all together, symbolizing the flowing river. The washerman and his wife emerge from the chorus, arguing in mime. Their actions are exaggerated but their voices are not heard.

A washerman was quarreling loudly with his wife. The boy stopped and asked:

Boy: Dear Sir, what is the matter? Why are you quarreling with your wife?

Narrator: The washerman said:

Washerman: You see, son, it was like this,

I gave her a pot, I gave her a pot.

And what did she do?

I gave her a pot, it cost a lot.

So you see, I have nothing to boil my clothes in before I wash them. And because of her, my trade will suffer.

Boy: Dear Sir, don't quarrel with your wife. Please take this pot of mine and use it.

Narrator: The washerman was very happy with the pot. He was so pleased with the boy's good nature that he gave him a nice coat in return.

The entire chorus praises the coat, ‘Wah, what a nice coat! Look at the colour! Seems very cozy! So soft and warm!' The washerman and his wife make their way back to the chorus.",5,CC-BY,Umesh P N,,en,0130_the-boy-and-the-drum.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0130,pb

Boy: As I walked along,

With my pot in hand, I met a washerman. Who gave me this coat so grand!

Oh so funny indeed!

People looking for things,

And I have what they need!

Narrator: The boy walked on, all the while admiring his grand coat. He soon came to a bridge, and there he was alarmed by what he saw.

For the following narration, the chorus makes the sound of a cold wind blowing. A man emerges from the chorus, shivering. He sits down, curled into a ball.

A man was shivering in the cold and he was not even wearing a shirt. He seemed to be hurt and was moaning in pain. The boy was very concerned and ran up to the man and said:

Boy: You seem to be bleeding,

You seem to be hurt! I'll try and get you some help. You also need a coat.

Narrator: The boy asked the man how he came to be in such a sorry state.

The man said:

"A crowd of thieves, they came and GOT me! They got me down, they got me out.

They took my purse, got all my money.

I tried to put up a good fight.

But they beat me up, they beat me bad.

They left me in pain, they left me hurt.

They took it all, even my shirt!

As the song ends the acting-robber group goes back to the chorus.

Narrator: The boy said:

Boy: Your need is greater than mine. Please take this coat. It will help you keep warm.

Narrator: The man was touched by the little lad's kindness. He thanked the boy profusely and presented him with the big fine horse he was riding.

The robbed man goes into the chorus, while the entire chorus mimes the riding of the horse with the sounds. A drum can accompany the rhythm. The chorus mimes the riding on the spot, while the boy rides his horse across the stage.

The boy was very happy and led the horse along, singing his song.

Boy: Oh so funny indeed!

People looking for things,

And I have what they need!

A man needs a shirt,

But all he has is a big fine horse!

I gave him my coat, what did I get?

His big fine horse, of course!

The ""horsing"" of both the boy and chorus stops. Another group emerges from the chorus. These include the bridegroom, his relatives, and the drummers of the party.",7,CC-BY,Umesh P N,,en,0130_the-boy-and-the-drum.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0130,pb
"Narrator: As he was walking along with his horse, he came upon a large party of gaily dressed people. They were part of a big wedding party with the bridegroom, and musicians. They seemed ready to go in a wedding procession, but all of them were sitting under a tree with long faces.

At this point, both the groom's party and the remaining chorus actors sing a popular wedding song, but in a slow and sad-sounding manner.

The boy stopped and asked them what made them look so depressed. The groom's father said:

Groom's father: You see, son, it's like this. We are all set to go in the wedding procession.

But we need a horse for the groom. The man who was supposed to bring it hasn't turned up, the auspicious hour is almost gone.

Narrator: And the groom himself stepped up to the boy and said:

Groom: I am the groom.

Waiting to see my bride,

But I'm stuck in here Just hoping for a ride!

I just can't go there on my feet.

My horse is late and so is the hour.

My guests are all waiting to eat.

I'll miss my wedding for sure!

So you see, what I need right now is a horse! I need a horse! A really quick horse!

"Narrator: And so the boy, being helpful as ever, offered his horse to the groom. The groom was very happy and he asked the boy what he could give him in exchange for his horse.

The boy looked around among the musicians and quickly spotted the drummer.

He said:

Boy: A stitch in time they say saves nine. And what indeed did save the day, Was this splendid horse of mine!

All I want from you is

That fine little drum that you play!

Oh, make my dreams come true!

Please make my dream come true!

The drummer steps forward with his drum, and hands it over to the boy during the following lines.",9,CC-BY,Umesh P N,,en,0130_the-boy-and-the-drum.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0130,pb
"Narrator: The groom requested the drummer to hand over the drum to the boy. The drummer knew he would easily get enough money to buy himself a brand new drum. He willingly gave his drum away.

The groom's actors and everyone else return to the main body of the chorus. All sing the wedding song, but now it is happy and up-tempo.

Narrator: The boy rushed home singing his song and playing his new drum. He could not wait to tell his mother how she had helped him to get his drum.

The boy and the mother meet at the centre of the stage.

Boy: My piece of wood did a lot of good!

It got me bread as food.

My piece of bread lasted not,

But gave me a lovely pot.

My pot got me a lovely coat.

The coat did help a needy man.

I got me a big fine horse to ride.

With that horse, I got a groom his bride!

So you see it is simple indeed

A little bit of give and take,

Will a lot of people happy make!

So when you meet your friends today,

Try and make their day!

The last verse is sung again by the entire chorus, which sings and dances around the boy. In the end, the actors all freeze in the positions of the various characters in the play.

"Stage setting:

The boxes below suggest a possible design for the play. Think of each of these boxes as a photograph of a particular scene. You could have the props, costumes, and musical instruments for the play on a bench placed against the back wall, and you could make use of them during the changing of the scenes behind the chorus.",11,CC-BY,Umesh P N,,en,0130_the-boy-and-the-drum.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0130,pb
"Suggestions for the cast

The play can be performed by a cast of six to thirty children. With more children, the role of the narrator and the boy can be assumed by many children, besides the other characters. For a cast of four to six children, the roles of the boy and the mother can be fixed, while the other children can take on the various other roles in the play. The stage directions given in the play are only meant as a suggestion or possibility. Please adapt the play to suit your needs in terms of availability of space (stage, classroom, hall etc.), props, sets and costumes.

Possible costumes: Regular comfortable clothes like t-shirts and pants or salwar and kameez, OR school uniform.

Possible props: Drum, stick, pot, dupattas, depending on availability. The entire play can also be done without any props, all of which can be mimed.

Simple musical instruments:

Simple musical instruments can be used or the chorus itself can make the appropriate sounds.

Suggested stage directions for a group of about 20 to 30 children.

Suggested stage directions for a group of about 20 to 30 children

All the children are facing away from the audience in three equal lines. A couple of narrators come in a very dramatic fashion. For example, the two of them can be playing a game of catch and suddenly they look at the audience, welcome them, and speak a little about the play together as a chorus: ""The story of the boy and the drum, a story about sharing, a story about values, a story about people and not things.""

The whole group turns to the audience and shouts out the title as one big chorus. The group stays in the three lines, now facing the audience.

From now on, the characters will step out of the chorus to the stage space in front and then back into the chorus when they are done with their part in the play.

The mother can wear a colored dupatta, which she gives to the boy when she gives him the piece of wood. All the other characters can also wear dupattas, which they exchange with the boy at the appropriate time. This action can symbolize sharing and giving, although this is not essential to the play's action.",12,CC-BY,Umesh P N,,en,0130_the-boy-and-the-drum.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0130,pb

"Munia knew that the giant, one-feathered elephant bird had not swallowed the horse. Yes, he was big enough to swallow a horse, but that didn't mean he had! The village of Adhania had only one horse-cart pulled by the two horses Vayu and Drut. And Vayu had gone missing near the lake in the jungle where the bird lived.

The villagers had known about the elephant bird for generations.",0,CC-BY,Arefa Tehsin,,en,0131_the-elephant-bird.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0131,pb
"He was the last of his race, which was considered extinct for hundreds of years. The world did not know that the living relic of that race, who had lost all his feathers but one, still roamed the jungles of Adhania.

The bird and the villagers kept a safe distance from each other. But not Munia. Although she walked with a limp, she was brave of heart. She often slipped into the jungle to watch the elephant bird.",1,CC-BY,Arefa Tehsin,,en,0131_the-elephant-bird.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0131,pb
"The elephant bird came near the lake in the daytime to bask in the sun or play in the lake alone splashing water. Sometimes he sat half-submerged in water. At other times there was no trace of him.

Perhaps he just rested in some corner of the dense jungle. He stood as tall as a tree. He had a long strong neck, huge legs with claws and a heavy spear-like head. His long talons and nails looked scary.",2,CC-BY,Arefa Tehsin,,en,0131_the-elephant-bird.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0131,pb
"But Munia soon realised he was a shy herbivorous bird. He just munched on leaves by the lakeside.

"One day, gathering courage, Munia stepped in the open near the lake. Without turning his head the elephant bird rolled his eyes towards Munia and then closed them, uninterested by her advance.

Getting no more attention than the flies buzzing over his head, Munia stomped her feet. Suddenly the elephant bird lifted one of his claws. Munia cried and fell headlong into the shallow waters of the lake. She came out drenched to see him shaking all over.

"“That's funny, huh?” she asked angrily and turned to leave. Before Munia had walked away from the clearing, something hit her feet. It was a fruit that the elephant bird had thrown at her. The elephant bird wanted to play! Hesitantly, Munia threw it at him. He trotted sideways and caught the fruit in his beak. Thus, Munia's friendship with the elephant bird had begun. And just when she had finally found a friend, Vayu had gone missing!

"After searching for Vayu high and low, the villagers gathered under the old banyan tree. Everyone agreed that there could be no thief in Adhania. They all trusted one another.

It must be something in the jungle that got him,” a villager addressed the headman. “Who else can it be but the giant one-feathered elephant bird? He must be destroyed!” said the milkman. “For years he has been lying silent, hatching his evil plans!”",7,CC-BY,Arefa Tehsin,,en,0131_the-elephant-bird.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0131,pb

"A cheer of approval went up. “The elephant bird did not eat the horse,” Munia said softly but firmly, limping forward. “I was with him when Vayu went missing!” A heavy silence fell on the gathering. “What does this mean?” roared the headman. “That the elephant bird is my friend, and he has not done this!”

“This girl has lost her mind!” shouted someone from the back. The other children laughed. “He only eats leaves! How can he eat Vayu?” Munia shouted, not moving from her place.",9,CC-BY,Arefa Tehsin,,en,0131_the-elephant-bird.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0131,pb

"Munia had only one night to prove the elephant bird's innocence. “Think, Munia, think!” she whispered to herself. “The milkman saw Vayu gallop away on the road that goes to the lake. But the road takes a turn before it reaches the lake and goes towards Chandesara. What if Vayu had gone that way?”

Munia's parents were angry with her and sent her to bed without speaking a word. Once they were asleep, she got out of bed, took the hanging lamp and stepped out of the house.",11,CC-BY,Arefa Tehsin,,en,0131_the-elephant-bird.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0131,pb
"She crossed Adhania, and came to the jungle path leading to Chandesara, the neighbouring village. Whoooo... rang the call of an owl in the jungle air. A jackal howled from a distance. The shadows of trees moved like long dark fingers. She hesitated for a moment but then thought of the elephant bird sleeping peacefully in the jungle. If she didn't do something to solve the mystery, the elephant bird may not be alive to see the next night.

"The next morning the villagers gathered near the lake with sticks, sharp stones and long kitchen knives. The elephant bird was resting when the crowd approached him. The sun shone on his featherless back. He got up slowly and stared at the crowd. Looking at his size, the villagers stopped at some distance. After a moment's hesitation the headman cried, “Be ready!” The mob roared, firming the grip on the weapons, ready to run down the giant one-feathered elephant bird.",13,CC-BY,Arefa Tehsin,,en,0131_the-elephant-bird.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0131,pb
"“Stop!” Munia's thin voice cut through the din. She limped between the mob and the giant.

“Munia! Come back at once!” her father ordered. “Grab her!” cried someone else.

The elephant bird advanced a couple of steps and they stopped. “Okay... if this is how you want it, we'll tackle both of you together!” yelled a man, holding a spear.",14,CC-BY,Arefa Tehsin,,en,0131_the-elephant-bird.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0131,pb
"“What's going on?” someone shouted from behind the crowd. A slightly hunched man with a long beard came in holding a horse's reins.

"Dear Reader,

The Indian Ocean is known as ‘Ratnakara' in ancient Sanskrit literature. Ratnakara means the mine of jewels.

Manta rays often visit cleaning stations. A cleaning station can be called nature's hospital in the ocean. Here, small fish such as angelfish swim in the manta ray's gills and over its skin. They are called cleaner fish because, they clean the manta ray by eating up parasites and dead tissue. Even though manta rays are huge, they are quite gentle.

They are hunted by many animals like big sharks, whales and humans.",8,CC-BY,"Mala Kumar, Manisha Chaudhry",,en,0134_pishi-caught-in-a-storm.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0134,pb

In India, there are three kinds of bears - The Himalayan Black Bear, The Brown Bear and The Sloth Bear. The bear in this book looks like a brown bear.

Bears like fresh growing shoots of grass. They also like fruits like apples, peaches and mulberries. Though brown bears do kill goats and other animals, they usually do not attack human beings.

During winter in cold places, bears in the wild do not get enough to eat. What do they do then? They just go to sleep for a very long time! This long sleep is called hibernation.

"I parked myself right under the big orange lantern and asked, “Do I look like a Lantern Queen?”
I waited for exactly three minutes. To my dismay, no one replied.
Rajjo was really busy in a deep conversation. “Rajjo, Rajjo, Rajjo, Rajjo!” I yelled.
She finally tore away from the deep discussion and looked at me.
“Do I look like a lantern queen?” I asked, again.
“You're mad.” said Rajjo. She looked away and promptly got back to her seemingly important discussion.
I now turned to Shriya. Surprisingly she was already staring at me. “Can you see how I'm letting that question just pass?” she said with her sharp eyebrow raised.
Sigh! The life of a Lantern Queen is going to be difficult; I thought and looked at Shruti.
Shruti was also already staring at me. But she had an I-am-observing-you look all over her face. After a close examination she finally said, “You look more like you have a jelly fish on your head.”
“So, I'm the Jelly Fish Queen?” I asked.
“Not a queen really...” said Shruti.
“So a layperson with a jelly fish on the head?” I confirmed.

“Yes.” she said.
“Oh! Okay.” I said and sat down.
What does Shruti know about the Lantern Queen, I thought.
They are all jealous. They don't want to acknowledge the fact that I am now the Lantern Queen.
It had to be! It is not every day that a huge lantern appears right about your head.
It had to mean something. And I knew exactly what it meant. Only these guys were being oblivious to the facts.
I decided that I had to leave for the day. I now had the responsibility of being the Lantern Queen.
I looked at my watch and saw it was almost 6.00 in the evening. So I started packing up.

I knew being the Lantern Queen was not going to be easy. I had to open up my mind and think profound thoughts. I had to let the light come in.
As I walked to the station, I saw a lady running behind a taxi. This was a rather common site in the mad Mumbai city.
But today, I pushed myself to look beyond the obvious and find the real meaning hidden behind this scene. What am I missing? There had to be something, I thought.
Think like the Lantern Queen! I told myself.
Then, out of nowhere, it came to me. I figured that running behind anything in life was a complete waste of energy. Running behind marks as a student, behind money as an adult, was all futile.
So, I took a conscious call. If the thing I want can walk with me at my pace, then it's going to be worth the effort. If I have to keep running behind something, then it is simply not going to be sustainable. For how long will I keep running?
And anyways, I didn't enjoy running much.
After this great analysis, I felt really enlightened. I had opened up my mind and this role-play was now becoming really interesting.
So with a spring in my step, I marched on towards the station.

I was carefully looking left to cross the road when a cabbie came by in full speed and splashed a whole lot of muck over my jeans.
If this were yet another day, I would have started running behind the cabbie while showering him with all the curse words I knew of.
But today, I kept my cool. I let him go and thought, why did this happen?
This time, the bulb in my head didn't go on. So, I did the most fun thing I could do in that moment. I walked right into that puddle of muck and jumped up and down till my whole top was dirty as well.
By the time I was out, I saw a million eyes staring at me. But, I didn't feel embarrassed. I was now the Lantern Queen, and they didn't know that the Lantern Queen could do anything.

I picked up my pace once again and walked towards the station.
Once I got onto my platform, I saw the most miraculous sight. Slowly pulling in was a 12-coach train that was completely empty!
For a city dweller, this situation is worthy of great emotions. I could feel a surge of emotions swell in me. I was elated beyond words.
I promptly stepped into the train and made myself comfortable for the ride back home.
Train journeys back home were my most favourite part of the day. I could feel the stress release my system. This was also my thinking time.
And so, I put my thinking cap on.
I pondered on what would the Lantern Queen do in this valuable free time?
I didn't have to think too long, as a fellow passenger soon gave me the answer by throwing a bag full of garbage out of the window.
I gently got up and sat next to that lady and told her, “Aunty, please don't throw things out of the window.”
“Why not?” she asked almost confused.
“Cause it can result in the spread of many diseases, aunty! If you have thrown some kind of food, then it will encourage the rodents and rats on the tracks. It is not at all hygienic.” I said.

“Is it? I didn't think of the outcome when I threw the bag outside. I have seen everyone do it, so I do it out of habit now.” explained the lady.
“Now you know better, no? So next time please wait till the platform comes? There are dustbins there!” I said.
“Okay, I will listen to you young lady. We must change with the times.” said the aunty.
We both exchanged really wide smiles and I felt really proud of myself.
I was shaken out of my thoughts when I heard the voice of the announcer announcing that the next destination was my station.
I dusted my outfit a little and got up.
The Lantern Queen now had to face her mother. This I knew was going to be a tough one.

After a quick auto ride from station to home, I found myself standing outside the door of my house.
I was a little worried now. My clothes were costly. I didn't want to be greeted by an angry mother.
So again, I forced myself to think like the Lantern Queen. And the bulb in my head did flicker, but it came right on.
I quickly rummaged my bag for the house key. I knew I had it in there somewhere. Soon enough, I found it.
I opened the door and ran into my room. “Hi Maa! I'm home,” I yelled as I crossed my parent's room.
By the time my mom came to see what was up, I was safely inside my bathroom.
“What are you doing inside?” enquired a suspicious mother.
“Ma! I am taking a bath!” I yelled.
“Why?” continued the suspicious mother.
“Because I feel like it Ma! I'm all sweaty.”
“Okay. I will see you at the dinner table. Be quick.” she ended.
I knew well that she was not convinced. Mothers have this instinct. They just know everything.
But this time I had escaped because I was the Lantern Queen. I washed my clothes squeaky clean and realised that a mistake is not really a mistake if one can undo it.
When I came out, mom was at the table.

She had made hot soup with fried bread.
I was so hungry that I gulped down two bowl-fulls.
By the end of it all, my full stomach was making me really drowsy.
“Can I go to sleep, ma?” I asked her.
“Are you sure everything is fine? Don't you want to share some office gossip today?” she asked.
“Yes ma! All is fine! I promise. I'm just sleepy.” I said.
“Fine, go to sleep. But you have to catch-up with me tomorrow.” she said before I pecked her on the cheek and headed straight to bed.

When I felt the warmth of the sun on my face, I knew it was morning.
I opened my eyes and saw that I was up much before the alarm.
This came as a pleasant surprise.
I felt like a true queen in her chamber. I got off the bed with great grace and poise.
I decided I will wear the royal purple and picked out my clothes from the wardrobe.
In no time, I was ready.
I went to my parent's room to find both of them happily chatting away over a cup of tea.
“Good morning from the queen!” I announced before I walked in.
“But aren't you our princess?” asked dad puzzled.
“Dad, I am multitasking!” I replied.
“Ahh, ok your highness.” replied dad.
With dad, it was always like this. No questions asked. Just go with the flow.
I had a quick cup of tea with them discussed the beautiful weather. As soon I was done with my cup, I took off for work.
The Lantern Queen was never late, I knew that.

My journey to work went as smooth as my morning. It flowed like a calm stream of the river. No jerks, no breaks, no peaks, no falls. No extremes.
I reached office a little before time. I punched-in and walked towards my team. With an air of superiority, I went and sat at my desk.
I put on the computer and looked up at my lantern.
What I saw now, shook me.
The lantern was gone! It was gone?
I didn't understand the meaning of this. I stood up to see where it had moved.
I stared at the receptionist with great anger. My lantern was right above her head.
“Who did that?” I asked Shruti, pointing towards the lantern.
“Must be of office boys. They are the ones in charge of the Diwali decorations, no? They must have moved it.”
“But, it was right above my head yesterday!” I complained.
“Yes, but now it is above the reception desk where everyone can see it and feel the Diwali feel!” said Shruti putting some sense in the discussion.
I turned away from her and sat down.
This was very upsetting. Was I the Lantern Queen just for a day? I didn't want to stop being the Lantern Queen. I was enjoying each and every minute of it.

This was depressing. There had to be a way out.
“Purvi, will you please come here?” called out my editor.
Like an obedient zombie, I got up and walked towards her desk.
“You know we are coming up with our Diwali Special issue, right?” she asked
“Yes ma'am.” I replied.
“So here is something that is going to make your day brighter. You have to come up with a fictional character and its story. We will carry this as a continuing series in the magazine till Diwali. This character has to talk about the festivities that are seen in the city right before the actual festival. Like a build-up, you know?”
My mind was racing now. “Yes, I get it.”
“This is quite a big opportunity for an intern, Purvi. You are getting it because the rest of the team has their hands full already. And if you get this right, we might consider you for a permanent employee too.” said my editor.
“Ma'am, umm, uh, err. Can this character be called the Lantern Queen?” I asked with all hope.
My editor fell silent for a few seconds. I could feel my heart beat pick up. I was sure it was audible to everyone else too now.
“Lantern Queen?” she asked,

“Hmm. Okay, that does have a ring to it. Quickly write your character sketch and treatment and send it across to me. Let's get this working.” she concluded.
What! Did I just hear that right? This had to be the best day of my life!
It was right then I realised that, by appearing above my head the previous day, the lantern had changed something. Its light had touched me and transformed me for life. It had ensured that I could not only be the Lantern Queen forever, but also write about it publically!
Somewhere deep down inside, I just knew this was my very own big break.
This Diwali was going to be full of lights, laughter and happiness.

"It was the strange sound coming from the living room that woke the little boy up. It was strange because it was 4:32 a.m. and no one should be in the living room making noises at 4:32 a.m. Of course, it was also strange because the sound - a cross between grunting and mooing - made it seem like there was a buffalo in the living room and that, the little boy thought, was very, very strange.

After waiting for another grunt-moo (just to make sure he wasn't dreaming), the boy climbed out of bed, pulled his sagging Batman pyjamas up higher and opened his bedroom door a crack. He smiled when he saw a water buffalo standing by the couch, not because he loved water buffaloes like he loved dogs, but because it meant he was right and the boy loved being right.

The buffalo let out another grunt-moo, as if in protest. It looked thoroughly bored and seemed to just want to go back to where it came from. The man sitting on the water buffalo - a fat man with leathery blue skin, a golden crown and a dhoti made of red silk - whacked the buffalo on its bottom and said, ""Patience, Paundraka! Can't you see this woman is crying?"" Paundraka let out a little angry huff and went back to looking bored, while the fat man turned to the weeping woman.

""Why is mummy crying?"" the little boy wondered. But before he could step out of the room to comfort his mother, the big blue man echoed his thoughts and asked her, ""Why are your crying, Nandini?"" He pinched his nose where his eyes met as he said this, trying very hard to not sound angry or tired.

The woman, who was sitting on the couch with her head in her hands, looked up at the blue man with big, red eyes, which became bigger when she heard this question. ""Why am I crying? Why am I crying?! I'm crying because you're here to take me away, just like you took away my husband. And then my little boy will be all alone, the poor thing. An orphan at the age of six. How dare you ask me why I'm crying!""

""Look Nandini,"" the blue man said, turning and twisting a rope he held in left hand, ""first of all, I didn't come to take your husband, your husband came to me. Of his own will. And second, we've been at this for three hours now and I can't wait any longer. Your boy will be fine. So come. Stand up now. You shouldn't keep the gods waiting.""

As he saw his mother stand up from the couch, her shoulders slumped in resignation, the boy got scared and wanted to run to her, but couldn't. It was like he was frozen in place. The blue man swirled the lasso deftly in his right hand and threw it at at the boy's mother. When he yanked it out, it came out empty.

""What's this?!"" the blue man cried. ""Where's your soul?""

The woman looked up at the man blankly and said , ""My soul, Yama? Oh, that's with my little boy. I don't keep mine on me.""

The man slapped his forehead and said, ""Well, I can't take your soul out of the little boy! What if I get the wrong one out? This has been an utter waste of my time."" Paundrakha grunt-mooed in agreement.

""Come on, Paundrakha,"" the man said kicking the buffalo's stomach lightly. ""We'll just have to come back another day."" And then, without so much as a goodbye, the man and the buffalo vanished.

Relieved for the moment, the woman wiped away her tears on her nightie's sleeve. She then went to the kitchen to get a drink of water when she noticed her little boy standing by his bedroom door, peeping at her through the shadows. The woman started at the sight of her son and almost dropped the glass of water in her hand.

“Now what are you doing out of bed?” she asked. Without waiting for an answer, she put the glass down, chased the little boy back inside and tucked him in angrily, saying, “Honestly, Bharat.

I'm Crunk. My friends and me were having a peaceful nap on that riverbank after a busy night of scavenging up and down the river for junk parts.

They appeared to be standard bots. Why did they need our service droid!

"For as far back as the villagers
could remember, they had taken
the time to keep this bird happy.
They saved scraps of bread, pieces

at the base of the tree, one of them
played a simple tune on the thumb

the ground to eat and drink. When

Because the rain fell regularly, the

forest after school. ""At least it will be cool in there,"" she thought to
herself. She walked and walked, and after some time, she came to
the tall tree in which the rain bird lived. Ketti stared up at the tree.
Suddenly, she remembered how her granny had taken her into the
forest to feed the bird when she was still a tiny child. Ketti opened
her school bag and pulled out a piece of bread left over from her
lunch. Carefully she laid the bread at the base of the tree. Then,
because she had no thumb piano with her, she sang an old song
that she had known all her life.",5,CC-BY-NC,Joanne Bloch (retold folktale),,en,0173_the-rain-bird-.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0173,asp

beautiful blue bird swooped out of
the branches above Ketti's head
and began to eat the bread. When
the bird had finished, she opened
her mouth and sang a few pure,
high notes.
Then she raised her shiny wings
and all of a sudden Ketti heard the
rumble of thunder. By the time she
reached her home, giant rain drops
were pelting down, cooling the
baking red earth.",6,CC-BY-NC,Joanne Bloch (retold folktale),,en,0173_the-rain-bird-.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0173,asp

happened. ""Don't be silly!"" scolded her mother. ""Nobody believes
that bird has anything to do with the rain anymore!""

broken now and we will be fine. Don't go wasting good bread
feeding that greedy old bird again!""
Though Ketti didn't argue with her parents, she felt sure they were
wrong. ""If only Granny were still alive,"" she said to herself, ""she
would have believed me!"" But Ketti's granny had died a few years
earlier. The only thing Ketti had left, was her granny's old thumb
piano.",7,CC-BY-NC,Joanne Bloch (retold folktale),,en,0173_the-rain-bird-.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0173,asp

more rain. The crops began to
shrivel up again and the hungry
animals' ribs began to stick out

taking a slice of bread and a
handful of red berries from the

angrily. He snatched his bow and arrows and silently followed Ketti
into the forest.
Just as the bird flew down to eat the food that Ketti had set out for
it, her father raised his bow and released his deadly arrow. The
arrow flew straight into the bird's heart. The bird let out a piercing
shriek.
Terrified, Ketti spun around − just in time to see her father fall
down, stone dead. Ketti screamed and turned around − just in
time to see the arrow fall harmlessly from the bird's glossy body.
Then the bird, unharmed, swooped up into the highest branch of
the tree.",10,CC-BY-NC,Joanne Bloch (retold folktale),,en,0173_the-rain-bird-.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0173,asp

Tjenga walked to his friend Ngu, to tell him what had happened.

Ngu said, ""Oh no! You are not my own family. I cannot make your problem my problem!""

Luckily the piece I was on did not burn and I was left in the icy region. I called for help. I saw an aeroplane above and waved a burning piece in the air. The people in the aeroplane saw me and picked me up. Since I looked shabby they gave me clothes to wear and food to eat. I was taken India!""

Riddle 3:

Get out of the magic patch and you will find your parents in India.

"This story happened during the great famine in Rajasthan. The village farmlands all over the state looked like wide spans of desert under the cloudless sky. The Villagers of Jaisalmer were not sure how to bring rain in their part of the village. Even the Traditional Folklore Singer couldn't bring blessings of rain with his heart-moving songs.

Eventually, the Folklore Singer decided to travel to the haunted village of Kuldhara to get the help of his Master's spirit.

Early next day, the Singer started from his village. He was confident that his wise Master would have a solution for his village's rain

problems. He was willing to face any challenge to find a solution.

After walking many miles, the Singer saw an object growing big slowly as he walked towards it. When he was close enough, he found a huge bone.

Now the Singer was greatly puzzled as to which animal it could possibly be to have such a huge skeleton. He then remembered his Master teaching him a folklore song that brought dead animals to life.

So he began singing with great joy and soon with each dip and fall of his song the bones got their life back. Almost at the end of the song

the huge bone structure turned to be a creature from the ancient past.

The creature was a Dinosaur which looked at him with wide-eyed wonder. The Singer was happy to bring life to the Dinosaur. Now that his work was done, he decided to walk his way to Kuldhara to meet his Master.

As he walking away, he heard the loud thumping of the Dinosaur's feet following him. He turned to the creature and said that he should go his way where ever he wishes to go.

But the creature would just smile at

him and lick his face. The Singer understood the creature is going to follow him all his way. In the end, he decided maybe he could show this creature to his Master after all and took him along with him.

The odd pair of the Singer and Dinosaur made their way toward Kuldhara. On the way the Singer would sing a few songs to keep him entertained and the Dinosaur would shake his head and tail keeping with the song's rhythm.

Soon they reached Kuldhara at night fall. The Singer walked to his Master's house. At the house, the door opened and all their needs were magically taken care.

That night, the Singer placed all the offering that he brought with him at his Master's prayer room altar and awaited his arrival. At the stroke of midnight the Master appeared before the Singer.

The Singer bowed before his Master's spirit and asked him for help to solve the rain problem of his village. The Master smiled and said, “You have travelled far, so rest a while. We will talk later tomorrow.”

“Master I even tried the rain song folklore too. Yet nothing happened and my people are thinking of leaving the village, please help me master,” cried the Singer in desperation.

“I did tell you that we will talk later. So don't worry, your answers will be with you in the morning,” said the Master's spirit.

The Singer as per his Master's command slept in house and the next day was getting ready to leave, when he heard someone singing off tune. He searched for the person singing so off-key.

A huge surprise waited for the Singer because the off-tune song was sung by the Dinosaur. The Dinosaur on seeing the Singer immediately stopped singing and said, “Did I disturb you?”

“You sounded a little off-key but you

have a nice voice though,” said the Singer not wishing to hurt the creature's feelings.

“Do you think that I can learn to sing?” asked the Dinosaur.

The Singer thought of the years of practice that goes into learning to sing. He didn't want to discourage the Dinosaur, so he said, “Yes, you can but you need to be dedicated to singing.”

The Singer visited his Master's prayer room altar and took his leave. He found a new rain song folklore wound with a red silken cloth.

The Singer read through it and thanked his Master for helping him with a new rain song. He was now had a plan of learning the song and making it rain in his village.

As the odd pair of the Singer and Dinosaur walked towards Jaisalmer, the Singer kept practicing the song on the way. The Dinosaur listened attentively to the song and kept time with his stomping.

By half the way, the Singer had learned the song as per his Master's notation. So he decided that he would sing it once to see if he got it right.

As he was singing, the cloud began

to crowd in and they seemed to be ready to rain. When the Singer looked out with hope the rain bearing cloud dispersed without showering rain. The Singer was greatly disappointed.

By then, the Singer and Dinosaur had reached traveling nomad's camp and joined them to rest for the night.

Once the camp members and the Singer had gone to bed for the night, the Dinosaur began his practice of his new song that he had been learning from listening to the Singer.

At one of the high pitches of the

song, the sleeping Singer woke up and heard the Dinosaur sing the rain song off-keys.

The Singer remembered the time when his Master had spoken about rainmaking songs. “The best rain songs are those that are sung as a duet!”

“Maybe this was the solution that Master has been hinting to me so long,” thought the Singer.

For the reminder of the way the Singer taught the Dinosaur how to sing the rain making song in tune. When they reached Jaisalmer the whole village was frightened of the huge Dinosaur.

But the Singer pacified them and told them it was a gentle and harmless creature who can sing. He also told them that he found a solution for making rain with his singing Dinosaur friend.

When the villagers heard that the Dinosaur could help with bringing rain, then, they began laughing and mocking them.

Just to prove the villager wrong and to strengthen his faith in his new found friend, the Singer decided to sing the rain song as a duet.

The unusual combination of the Singer and the Dinosaur's rain song moved the sky

so much that the rain bearing clouds gathered and there fell huge showers of rain with lightening. The rain drenched the village with life-giving water and it was the best reward from the sky to earth for the soul-moving rain song duet.

Soon both the Singer and the Dinosaur became famous as a rain making songster pair. So whenever there was a need for rain this pair of odd singers would visit the village and sing their duet to make the sky reward them with showers of rain.

With a warm smile and reassuring nod, thatha said that this is one place where Math skills will help.

"They told me the big black Lab's name was Reggie, as I looked at him lying in his pen.. The shelter was clean, no-kill, and the people really friendly. I'd only been in the area for six months, but everywhere I went in the small college town, people were welcoming and open. Everyone waves when you pass them on the street.

But something was still missing as I attempted to settle in to my new life here, and I thought a dog couldn't hurt. Give me someone to talk to. And I had just seen Reggie's advertisement on the local news. The shelter said they had received numerous calls right after, but they said the people who had come down to see him just didn't look like “Lab people,” whatever that meant. They must've thought I did.

But at first, I thought the shelter had misjudged me in giving me Reggie and his things, which consisted of a dog pad, bag of toys almost all of which were brand new tennis balls, his dishes, and a sealed letter from his previous owner. See, Reggie and I didn't really hit it off when we got home. We struggled for two weeks (which is how long the shelter told me to give him to adjust to his new home). Maybe it was the fact that I was trying to adjust, too. Maybe we were too much alike.

For some reason, his stuff (except for the tennis balls — he wouldn't go anywhere without two stuffed in his mouth) got tossed in with all of my other unpacked boxes.

I guess I didn't really think he'd need all his old stuff, that I'd get him new things once he settled in. But it became pretty clear pretty soon that he wasn't going to.

I tried the normal commands the shelter told me he knew, ones like “sit” and “stay” and “come” and “heel,” and he'd follow them – when he felt like it.

He never really seemed to listen when I called his name — sure, he'd look in my direction after the fourth or fifth time I said it, but then he'd just go back to doing whatever.

When I'd ask again, you could almost see him sigh and then grudgingly obey.

This just wasn't going to work. He chewed a couple shoes and some unpacked boxes.

I was a little too stern with him and he resented it, I could tell. The friction got so bad that I couldn't wait for the two weeks to be up, and when it was, I was in full-on search mode for my cell phone amid all of my unpacked stuff. I remembered leaving it on the stack of boxes for the guest room, but I also mumbled, rather cynically, that the “damn dog probably hid it on me.”

Finally I found it, but before I could punch up the shelter's number, I also found his pad and other toys from the shelter...I tossed the pad in Reggie's
direction and he snuffed it and wagged, some of the most enthusiasm I'd seen since bringing him home. But then I called, “Hey, Reggie, you like that? Come here and I'll give you a treat.” Instead, he sort of glanced in my direction — maybe “glared” is more accurate — and then gave a discontented sigh and flopped down .... with his back to me.

Well, that's not going to do it either, I thought. And I punched the shelter phone number. But I hung up when I saw the sealed envelope. I had completely forgotten about that, too.

“Okay, Reggie,” I said out loud, “let's see if your previous owner has any advice.”
____________ _________ _________ _________

To Whoever Gets My Dog:

Well, I can't say that I'm happy you're reading this, a letter I told the shelter could only be opened by Reggie's new owner. I'm not even happy writing it. If you're reading this, it means I just got back from my last car ride with my Lab after dropping him off at the shelter. He knew something was different.

I have packed up his pad and toys before and set them by the back door before a trip, but this time... it's like he knew something was wrong. And something is wrong...which is why I have to try to make it right.

So let me tell you about my Lab in the hopes that it will help you bond with him and he with you.

First, he loves tennis balls. The more the merrier. Sometimes I think he's part
squirrel, the way he hordes them. He usually always has two in his mouth, and he tries to get a third in there. Hasn't done it yet. Doesn't matter where you throw them, he'll bound after it, so be careful – really don't do it by any roads. I made that mistake once, and it almost cost him dearly.

Next, commands. The shelter staff probably already told you, but I'll go over them again: Reggie knows the obvious ones — “sit,” “stay,” “come,” “heel.” He knows hand signals: “back” to turn around and go back when you put your hand straight up; and “over” if you put your hand out right or left. “Shake” for shaking water off, and “paw” for a high-five. He does “down” when he feels like lying down — I bet you could work on that with him some more. He knows “ball” and “food” and “bone” and “treat” like nobody's business. Nothing opens his ears like little pieces of hot dog. I trained Reggie with small food treats.

Feeding schedule: twice a day, once about seven in the morning, and again at six in the evening. Regular store-bought stuff; the shelter has the brand.

He's up on his shots. Call the clinic on 9th Street and update his info with yours; they'll make sure to send you reminders for when he's due. Be forewarned: Reggie hates the vet.

Good luck getting him in the car. I don't know how he knows when it's time to go to the vet, but he knows.

Finally, give him some time. I've never been married, so it's only been Reggie and me for his whole life. He's gone everywhere with me, so please include him on your daily car rides if you can. He sits well in the backseat, and he doesn't bark or complain. He just loves to be around people, and me most especially. Which means that this transition is going to be hard, with him going to live with someone new.

And that's why I need to share one more bit of info with you....

His name's not Reggie. I don't know what made me do it, but when I dropped him off at the shelter, I told them his name was Reggie.

He's a smart dog, he'll get used to it and will respond to it, of that I have no doubt. But I just couldn't bear to give them his real name. For me to do that, it seemed so final, that handing him over to the shelter was as good as me admitting that I'd never see him again. And if I end up coming back, getting him, and tearing up this letter, it means everything's fine. But if someone else is reading it, well ... well it means that his new owner should know his real name. It'll help you bond with him. Who knows, maybe you'll even notice a change in his demeanor if he's been giving you problems. even though, frankly, I'm just writing it for my dog. I couldn't imagine if I was writing it for a wife and kids and family ... but still, Tank has been my family for the last six years, almost as long as the Army has been my family. His real name is “Tank”, because that is what I drive.

Again, if you're reading this and you're from the area, maybe my name has been on the news. I told the shelter that they couldn't make “Reggie” available for adoption until they received word from my company commander. See, my parents are gone, I have no siblings, no one I could've left Tank with ... and it was my only real request of the Army upon my deployment to Iraq , that they make one phone call.. the shelter ... in the “event” ... to tell them that Tank could be put up for adoption. Luckily, my colonel is a dog guy, too, and he knew where my platoon was headed. He said he'd do it personally. And if you're reading this, then he made good on his word.

Well, this letter is getting downright depressing.

And now I hope and pray that you make him part of your family and that he will adjust and come to love you the same way he loved me.

That unconditional love from a dog is what I take with me to Iraq as an inspiration to do something selfless, to protect innocent people from those
who would do terrible things ... and to keep those terrible people from coming over here. If I have to give up Tank in order to do it, I am glad to have done so. He is my example of service and of love. I hope I honored him by my service to my country and comrades.

All right, that's enough. I deploy this evening and have to drop this letter off at the shelter. I don't think I'll say another good-bye to Tank, though. I cried too much the first time. Maybe I'll peek in on him and see if he finally got that third tennis ball in his mouth.

Good luck with Tank. Give him a good home, and give him an extra kiss goodnight – every night – from me.",0,CC-BY,Ria r,,en,0227_the-dog.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0227,pb

"There was an old widow who had two sons and two daughters-in-law. They mistreated her all day long which made her very sad. The widow kept her sadness within herself and soon she grew heavy with the burden of her grief. On seeing her getting fat, her sons and daughters-in-law complained and served her less food.

One day, they left her alone in the house while they went out to enjoy themselves in the village fair. The sheer misery of being alone with her sadness forced her to wander the streets. She came across a decaying house that seemed to reflect her state of mind and she ventured into it.

The cracked walls seemed to invite her and her sorrow. She began to narrate how her first son tormented her. The wall on hearing her sad story collapsed, unable to bear the weight of her sorrow.

Even after sharing her sorrow she felt stifled with her inner emotions. Then she shared how her first son's wife abused and disappointed her. The second wall buckled under her narration.

Half the burden of her sorrow was released and taking this cue of sharing her emotional burden made her share the ill-treatment that she met at the hands of her second son.

The wall crumbled under the narration's power of expression. Soon the fourth wall also crumbled as she narrated about the cruelty she met at the hands of her daughter-in-law.

Eventually, all the four walls laden with old widow's tear just crumbled down. The widow then returned home feeling much better and light-hearted.",0,CC-BY,Srividya Suryanarayanan,,en,0246_crumbled-tear-laden-walls.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0246,pb

  A habit is a sticky thing;

Much good or evil it can bring;

It binds a victim, holds him fast,

And keeps him in a vise-like grasp.

  Bad habits grow with extra speed,

Much like a healthy,growing weed.

The roots grow deep,the stem grows stout;

How difficult to pull it out!

 Good habits are a little slow;

They need a lot of care to grow;

If tended well,they grow more fair

Than any bloom a plant can bear.

  Good habits help us all through life;

Bad habits bring us pain and strife;

Our habits weather right or wrong,

Each day will grow more firm and strong.",0,CC-BY,Rachita Uday Kumar,,en,0252_the-book-of-poems.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0252,pb

"There was once a girl called Thaimi who lived in the village of
Ombalantu. One day she went with her brother, Angula, to fetch
water. While Thaimi was filling her pot Angula saw a hare. He ran
after it. He ran and ran and ran - but do you think he could catch
that hare? He could not. The hare was too quick for him.
Thaimi's pot was full and she was ready to go home. She looked
around but she could not see Angula. She did not know where he
had gone. But, she did know that she couldn't go home without
her little brother. So she set out to look for him. She walked and
she walked and she walked.
At last she found him lying in the grass behind a large anthill. As
she came close he held his finger to his lips. Why did he want her
to be quiet? Close by a group of strange men were resting. The
men had bows and arrows...and spears! Thaimi could hear their
voices.
""Angula,"" she whispered, after she had listened for a bit. ""Those
men are raiders. They have come to steal our cattle and burn our
village. Come quickly. We must run home and warn the village."" So
very quietly Thaimi and Angula crept away from that place. And
ran towards their village.",1,CC-BY,"Karen von Wiese, Beryl Salt, Muhdni Grimwood, Barbara Meyerowitz",,en,0252_the-tree-that-saved-the-village-of-ombalantu.md,global-asp/asp-source,eng,Latn,asp_0252,asp

taking his cow to the water. Thaimi called out, ""Run, uncle, run!

The man shouted at his cow and made her run towards the village.
Further on Thaimi saw her aunt working in the field and she called
out, ""Run, aunt, run! Men are coming to steal our cattle and burn
our village!""
And the woman took her hoe, picked up her sleeping baby and ran
towards the village.
Further on Thaimi saw her grandfather. He was limping along the
road beside a donkey loaded with grain.

""No, Thaimi. That is our secret. You said we must never tell
anyone.""

climbed to the top of the tree. There was a small opening.
Thaimi and her father slid down into the big trunk. It was hollow. It
was huge. ""But all the people can't come in through such a small
hole,"" said her father.
""No,"" said Thaimi. ""Bring axes and we will make an opening in the
trunk."" And that is what they did. They cut an opening in the side
of the tree. Some villagers collected the grain and the pots.
Others collected the goats, the sheep and the cattle. They all
made their way through the opening into the great hollow inside
the baobab tree.

What was going to happen?
They were cold. They were hungry. And they were afraid.

stones and struck them together. The sparks caught the grass and

"Yusuf was a bus conductor. He wasn't highly educated, nor was he extremely pious. He was a simple guy who loved his family. He was hardworking and a simple person. A typical day for him meant getting up early, completing his religious prayers, helping his wife with some chores, and depending on his duty shifts either dropping or picking the children from school. He was a private man. He lived in a ‘basti' in Mumbai, and harbored dreams that his children should be well educated and get good jobs. He had friends from all religions and he never considered his two daughters any less than a boy.

She looked up and nodded and said “My vehicle broke down and I am waiting for an auto or a cab to come by” Yusuf informed her that this part of the road was usually empty at nights and she might not find an auto or cab.

It's just something any decent man would have done” Yusuf added “My daughters too go on their own to school or tuitions.

"Welcome to the 2nd part of Hacking Is Life.

So lets continue with a young mind with a lot of power that could change the world, Alex a school kid who is 12 years old when he made a virus an online software as you read in the 1st part of this e- book so go and check out the first version! ............................................................

Next day when he checked the victim count he was shocked! It was 99945213 people who were the victims! Now he could use there data use there computer! Access there Gmail, Facebook, Twitter accounts! And 4 foolish people of 99945213 people gave there bank accounts so Alex decided to access there webcam, bank account, and social networking sites to check out are they poor or so much rich

When he accessed the first persons webcam and saw his picture and his house he saw that his bank account only had 5 $ and he was from U. S. A and his video that was coming was as that he applied for a IPHONE 6 plus for free (which was Alex, s virus window loop ) he too said that ""we will sell that iphone and then we can do our dad's operation '' he said this to her sister :( Alex thought that he should not take his money . Alex could hack bitcoins which are called the internet currency so he hacked his computer again and made a window that popped up saying ""you won 300000 $ "" that Alex made and then when the victim clicked to the button what to do now? Alex donated 300000 $ to his bank account! Alex is good too! Then the victim was happy and then he went to a hospital's site saying please give money for the operation . All the left 3 were the most greedy people so what? Alex took there all money! Because all of 3 people were hackers :P it's ironic a little.

The time he was doing this all, someone tracked him . When Alex went out of his house for some fresh air, then he saw a person running to him and then the person caught him and injected something to him using a injection! When he woke he saw three people who were standing, those three people told him to hack some bitcoins! Alex replied ""you can track me and can't hack some bitcoins shame on you!"" one of then said ""you ... You .. Knew it?""

Yeah said Alex . Then one of them said just hack! He got a laptop and put that in a table and said hack using it! Alex replied ""ok"" and you know if a hacker got a laptop anything could happen! So yeah L. O. L he remade computer operating systems and that software could match his computer's data to it you know what I am saying. Then he destroyed the computer's every single software and before that he tracked himself that where he is and booked a taxi silently, after all this he shutted the laptop down and

Saw that there were 4 people, one was in the bathroom and second was talking to someone and third was just walking and fourth was in the next to that room then you know what Alex did? He shutted the laptop down and with full power he threw it at the head of the second person and when the third person noticed it there was a foke near him he throw to the third person and then he locked the toilets door and slowly went out and locked all the doors from the outside and then ran and caught the taxi and when he returned home his mother father gave the money to the driver and said to Alex where was you from these three hour? Alex replied ""at a friend's house""

I lead a very busy life. I find new kingdoms, solve new mysteries, make new friends, and save them when in trouble too.

All in day's job. Meet the new friend I met today. King Bholu. King Bholu is the king of a lost kingdom, Bholuland where everyone gets lost. And King Bholu is scared that he will lose his job.

App my way! Of course.

I got the perfect way to help Bholu. MOOGLE MAPS!

Guess what, just 15 minutes of Moogle Maps training, and King Bholu is all set now to find a new way to manage his kingdom. Moogle maps makes sure you can never lose your way. With Moogle Maps at his service, he will never get lost again.

It's King Bholu's birthday tomorrow. I am so happy he won't lose the direction to his own birthday party anymore.

You want to attend? I have heard it's going to be a grand affair with lots of cakes and no grey fishes. (He still has nightmares, you see).

As they went into the caves they had seen the rocky wall and tried to see if they could find any more paintings when suddenly Julie tripped over something and fell onto the ground. As soon as she got up, she found many tools and weapons made of stone which belonged to people of the past. After visiting the caves, they started back in their ship to Martina's house.

2. A curious case of the bees is that when they do the work of a younger bee, their brain stops ageing. It starts working like a younger bees' brain. Do you now wish you were a bee?

3. Bees recognize faces just like human beings do. Each part of the face is first taken separately, then put together to make up the face. Remember not to anger a bee!",7,CC-BY,Nabanita Deshmukh,,en,0304_why-do-bees-buzz.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0304,pb
"4. Caffeine, a chemical used by plants to keep away harmful insects, helps bees remember the location of the flower. It welcomes the bees for a second visit.

5. Bumble bees are larger than honey bees and other types of bees. They live in hives and love to socialise. Many bumble bees do not have a sting. They may not produce much honey but are excellent pollinators.",8,CC-BY,Nabanita Deshmukh,,en,0304_why-do-bees-buzz.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0304,pb

1. A honey bee performs a dance that tells the rest of the hive where to find nectar. Now try to express some information through dance moves, and see if your friends are able to understand what you are communicating!

2. Try buzzing like a bee... flap your arms and see if you can hear a buzz.",9,CC-BY,Nabanita Deshmukh,,en,0304_why-do-bees-buzz.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0304,pb
"3. A honeycomb, the house of the bees, is known to be a masterpiece of engineering. Why do you think? Try and draw perfect hexagons as in a honeycomb. Or make models using ordinary cartons. Maybe you'll guess the answer then!

4. Try to carefully smell different flowers. You could then imagine how honey made from the nectar of different flowers can also taste different.",10,CC-BY,Nabanita Deshmukh,,en,0304_why-do-bees-buzz.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0304,pb

As a result, that area was struck with drought. The rivers went dry and the trees and plants began to die. People were in distress.

"But Indra was a strategist and a witty God. He ordered one of his beloved pets, a cute blue dragon to become his substitute and visit this land struck with drought.

This blue dragon unlike other dragons didn't breath fire. He instead had a unique ability to breath clouds! Large puffy clouds.

He was a playful dragon and just like his master was witty and intelligent! He loved flying over the golden sun, high in the sky and over the deep green pastures of land below . But what he loved the most was, making clouds - clouds of all types, shapes and sizes.",1,CC-BY,Nidhi Jha,,en,0305_the-cloud-dragon.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0305,pb

So, the blue dragon made a huge blue rain cloud that covered the central part of the dry land. This cloud was monstrous in size and heavy enough to take the weight of a dragon.

After the cloud was ready, the dragon hopped upon it and struck lightning. Rains came down from the clouds and quenched the land's thirst.",3,CC-BY,Nidhi Jha,,en,0305_the-cloud-dragon.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0305,pb

Now Raj remembered.

"" How are you?"" he asked.

"" I am fine"", said Raj.
""You are a very nice and kind little boy"", the man said. And he gave him a huge trophy which said ""The Most Kindest Person"".

I would also like to help you with anything you need. Please come and meet me later with your mother. Raj was very happy and his mother was very proud of her son.

### The making of this play

It is great fun to be able to act and direct plays on your own. When Meera Dixit was looking for a contemporary play that could be enjoyable as well as easy to perform by students, she could not find the right one for the situation. So she wrote this play which her students could stage without professional help. It was first staged in 2011 and has been a big hit with students every time it has been performed.

### Designing the costumes for Yamraja and Yamdoot

Be creative. Use paper, newspaper, thermacol and other material available in school to create the settings.

This play works well with three settings - the garden where the characters first meet, an indoor room, and Yamraja's durbar. Three of the characters need specific costumes, or just headgear and jewellery to set them apart from the other characters. They could wear beaded necklaces and head gear made out of papier mache.

### Music and drama

Make up a jingle or a chorus. A few singers could sing these with musical accompaniments from the wings to set the mood for a scene, or to add drama to important moments in the play.

### No permission needed

You must have observed that at the end of most plays in books, there is a line that states that you need the permission of the playwright to stage the play. However, to stage this play you need not do so as it is copyright-free. This means you can stage the play as you wish. Feel free to incorporate new ideas.

### Scene 1

When the curtain opens, there are a few children on stage, in a garden setting. They are discussing something.

__Rita:__ Hey, have you heard about Vikram? It seems he has malaria. No wonder he had such a high fever!

__Rakesh:__ Yes, I heard about it. I spoke to his mother yesterday. She said that he is finally being treated with the right medicines.

__Sheela:__ Poor fellow, how on earth is he going to write his exams now?

__Yash:__ Silly girl, how can he be a poor fellow? Lucky he can't write the exams. How I envy him! No studying, no tension, no mother breathing down his neck. Just lie there waiting to get better... Poor fellow, my foot. _(Going near Rita)_ Look at me, all I do is study all day.

__Rita:__ _(laughs)_ Naturally you have to study all day. How will you pass otherwise, stupid?

__Yash:__ Don't you have anything better to do than to pull my leg? Wait till I tell the gang about what you did the other day! You know, she... _(Rita stops him.)_

__Rita:__ Sh! Sh! If you say anything more I will...

__Rohan:__ Oh no! The third world war is about to begin. You two never give up, do you?

__Yash:__ It's her, she is so.. so.. so... irritating! Just because she studies well she thinks no end of herself.

__Rita:__ I don't give up! Ha! It's Yash who starts the fight, not me.

__Rohan:__ Stop it, you two! You're worse than kids. Hurry up, don't you remember we have to go and see Vikram?

_(Yash and Rita are making faces at one another. All depart from one wing of the stage. Return to the stage from another wing)_.

### Scene 2

_(This is Vikram's home. The children can hear Vikram speaking to an unfamiliar voice. As they enter they can see that Vikram is talking to someone. This person is dressed weirdly, and looks like a mythological character. He is Yamdoot, Yamraj's messenger.)_

__Yamdoot:__ _(Yamdoot is talking to Vikram who is lying on his bed)_ Come on child.

"__Vikram:__ _(Looks confused)_ What do you mean come with me to my world? Who, may I know, has sent you? _(pointing to the paper)_ And what is that?

_(Vikram is trying to look at the paper, Yamdoot is trying to pull him out of the bed and all the while gazing at the clock. The children are watching all this and are trying to figure out what is happening)_.

__Vikram:__ Hey! What are you doing? Why are you trying to lift me? Listen...

__Yamdoot:__ I am Yamdoot, Yamraj's messenger. And, I do not have to listen to you. I only listen to my boss. Understood? Come on, get up! _(looks at his paper)_ We have to leave. Once I hand you over to Yamraj, I have an immediate appointment in Delhi. You see, we Yamdoots are very busy these days.

Hey, _(goes very close to Vikram)_ let me tell you something. I love to work overtime, we get paid well for that. But enough is enough. We have to leave now kiddo, too much overtime is not good either. _(He is about to drag Vikram out and leave when the children decide to take action.)_

__Yash:__ _(steps out and stops him)_ Hey, who are you and what are you doing?

__Sheela:__ Yes, tell us....

__Rita:__ _(Walks around Yamdoot, looking very official)_ So you call yourself Yamdoot. And where do you think you are taking Vikram? _(Yamdoot has a firm grip on Vikram's hand)_

__Vikram:__ _(looking surprised)_ Hello all of you!

__Rakesh:__ Hi! How are you feeling now, Vikram?

__Vikram:__ Better, much better. But never mind me. Meet my visitor who calls himself Yamdoot. _(Yamdoot glares)_

He says Yamraj has ordered him to take me to his abode.

__Rakesh:__ He is going to take you? Where? _(looks up)_

__Sheila:__ This is too much!

__Rohan:__ Yamdoot, whom are you taking with you? Him? _(points to Vikram)_ Without our permission? How dare you!

__Yash:__ _(Putting his hand on Yamdoot's shoulder)_ Listen Yambhaiyya. This is Vikram, our best friend and the head of our gang.

__Sheela:__ _(Shoving Yash aside)_ Also the captain of our cricket team!

__Rakesh:__ All right. So he has malaria. That does not mean that you can pick him up and take him away.

__Rita:__ This is simply not acceptable! It's sheer dadagiri!

__Rohan:__ This is not dadagiri. This is Yamgiri my dear. Yamgiri!

_(By now Yamdoot is thoroughly irritated, and very confused. He is touching his moustache knowing full well that if he does not take Vikram to Yamraj all hell will break loose. The very idea is frightening and he looks worried.)_

__Yash:__ Nothing doing Yambhai. You cannot take Vikram with you and that's final. _(tries to pull Vikram towards him, Yamdoot does likewise.)_

__Yamdoot:__ I am very confused.

__Rakesh:__ We can see that. _(laughs)_ Anyway, one thing is definite. Vikram is not going anywhere. Is that clear?

__Rohan:__ How can you just take him like that?

__Yash:__ You need to have some sense to understand things. _(Yamdoot puts his hands to his head, getting quite angry)_

__Yamdoot:__ Hey Bhagwan! _(Realizes his mistake)_ Yamraj what do I do now? Why don't these kids understand that Vikram has to go with me.

Come, we are getting very late. _(Pulls him. Rohan stands in front of them like a shield. Holds on to Yamdoot.)_

__Yamdoot:__ _(Upset)_ What shall I do with you now?

__Rohan:__ Whatever you want. I am all yours.

__Yash:__ _(Laughs)_ Ya, so what was Rakesh telling you my friend?

__Yamdoot:__ Me?

__Yash:__ Yes you.

__Sheela:__ It is only a matter of time before he gets better. Here, look at his medicines _(Drags Yamdoot to the medicines. He is worried.)_

__Vikram:__ Yes, see these are my tablets. And my fever is almost gone.

__Rita:__ There you go. He is going to be fit and fine in just a few days. _(Stamps her foot by mistake on Yamdoot's foot.)_

__Yamdoot:__ Awww...

__Sheela:__ Anyway, now you know that in India malaria is a curable disease. So how can you take him away?

__Rakesh:__ Go find another target.

__Yamdoot:__ Ha! How can Vikram get better? _(Takes out the paper)_ Look at the expiry date. It is now. So stop all your nonsense. _(Shoves the kids away.)_ I must leave with him. He has to die.

_(The kids start beating Yamdoot)_

__Yash:__ If anybody has to die it is YOU not him. _(pointing to Vikram)_

__Yamdoot:__ Oh god.. please stop beating me! Are your fists made of iron! Oh stop... I'm dying!

__Yash:__ Oh, this was just a sample of what is to come. Do you want to see what is in store for you?

__Yamdoot:__ No, no! _(in a pitiable voice)_

__Rohan:__ _(Holding Yamdoot)_ Alright. But only on one condition. Vikram goes no where. Or else... _(raised hand)_

__Yamdoot:__ That is not possible. He has to go with me. If I do not produce him in Yamraj's darbar, I will lose my job. How will I run my house then? How expensive things have become...

__Sheela:__ Who cares about your job!

__Rita:__ Fine. If you insist on taking Vikram, you can.

__Yamdoot:__ Really? _(eyes lit up)_

__Rakesh:__ Yes, but only on one condition. If you take him you have to take all of us too...

__Sheela:__ ...as we want to meet this Yamraj.

__Rakesh:__ Yes, we want to meet him. Who is he to decide that just because Vikram has malaria he must be taken away?

_(They all surround Yamdoot shouting slogans. By now Yamdoot is at his wit's end. He knows that now he has no choice.)_

__Chorus:__ Down with bullies! Down, down bullies!

You were supposed to bring only one child but you seem to have brought a whole cricket team. Your math was always a little weak. _(Gatekeeper smiles to himself)_

__Yamdoot:__ Oh god, here I am almost dead, and he is teasing me?! Do you think I am stupid? _(to the gatekeeper)_ Can't you see? Look at me! Look at my clothes, my cheeks – they are red and I am in pain. Bully!

_(By now the children are getting, very impatient. They are dying to meet Yamraj. Rohan is holding on to Vikram's hand in a firm grip)_

__Yamdoot:__ These kids just did not want to listen to anything I said. They insisted that if I took Vikram they would come along too. And when I said no, they slapped me. Look at my cheeks.

__Rohan:__ Naturally! All Vikram has is malaria and he is going to get well soon. Who is Yamraj to pick on Vikram for no reason?

__Yamdoot:__ Yes Maharaj, I have brought him. But his friends insisted on coming along too. They just would not listen to me, Maharaj. They forced me to bring them too and beat me up when I refused. Look at my cheeks, they are so red.

"Pa has put some whole-wheat flour in a big dish. He adds a little oil and some salt and starts mixing water into the flour.

How come the flour is absorbing the water readily?
Well, the reason is, something in the wheat flour is very thirsty! When you are thirsty what do you do? You drink water.

Gliadin and Glutenin are the two types of proteins in the wheat. Proteins and all other chemical substances are made up of tiny units called molecules. The molecules in these proteins are very thirsty.

As soon as water is put in the flour, these molecules drink it. Then they become big and fat. They expand. Naturally, they don't have enough space to sit comfortably. So they touch and push each other. They actually stick to each other.",2,CC-BY,Varsha Joshi,,en,0318_why-does-a-poori-puff-up.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0318,pb

kneaded the pooris won't puff.

How are these two related?
Here is the secret.

When you knead the dough, the molecules that are stuck to each other, Now start stretching. When this stretching is complete, a new protein is formed. It is called Gluten. Gluten is elastic like a rubber band and so we can give any shape to that dough.

Ma has left the dough aside for some time. She is now preparing the kheer. Aditi and Aarav decide to come back when she starts rolling the pooris.",4,CC-BY,Varsha Joshi,,en,0318_why-does-a-poori-puff-up.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0318,pb

"Here is what happens to the poori. The rolling is possible due to the Gluten in the dough. When the small piece of dough is rolled, a Gluten sheet is formed in the poori.

When the poori is put in the hot oil, its lower surface becomes very hot due to the oil.

Do you remember that water was used for making the dough? So, due to the high temperature, the water in the poori turns into steam. This steam is very powerful and it lifts up the sheet of Gluten. And that is why the poori puffs.

Pa now turns the poori so that the other surface also turns golden. He has taken the poori out of the pan and kept it in a dish.",6,CC-BY,Varsha Joshi,,en,0318_why-does-a-poori-puff-up.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0318,pb

"Why are the pooris used for bhel-poori, aloo–dahi-poori not puffed?

There could be three reasons:

If the poori is rolled very thin, there is not sufficient water in it for steam to form and for the pressure to build up so that the poori can puff.

Sometimes after the pooris are rolled, thin holes are made in them with a fork so that while frying, whatever steam is created, it comes out of the holes and does not let the poori puff. Such flat pooris can be used for longer.

Also if pooris are fried at low temperatures, steam forms very slowly, pressure does not build up and the poori does not puff.

Now you know why some pooris puff up, and why some pooris don't!",8,CC-BY,Varsha Joshi,,en,0318_why-does-a-poori-puff-up.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0318,pb
"Experiment to get gluten from wheat flour

Make dough using wheat flour and water. Use only adequate amount of water so that the dough would not be too hard or too soft.

Use the lower portion of the palm and knead the dough for few minutes. If necessary, little oil can be used so that the dough does not stick to your palm. Leave the dough covered for about ten minutes.

Now take a big bowl and put the dough in it after kneading it for few minutes again.

Pour water on the dough in the bowl so that it is completely immersed in water. Continue kneading the dough in water till the water becomes white. Throw the water out and put fresh water in the bowl.

Repeat the procedure till you observe that a small portion of the dough now remains which when kneaded water does not turn white.

This means all the starch from the dough is removed and only gluten has remained. This is because starch dissolves in water but gluten does not.

Take out the small portion of the dough which is gluten. You can stretch it like a rubber band. If you stretch it and leave it comes back to original state. This demonstrates the elasticity in it. You can spread it horizontally. This demonstrates the plasticity in it.",9,CC-BY,Varsha Joshi,,en,0318_why-does-a-poori-puff-up.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0318,pb

"Well, fireflies or ‘lightning bugs' as they are sometimes called do the same, except that they have an unlimited supply of light within themselves!

"The glow of the firefly is produced by a protein called luciferase and a pigment called luciferin. Proteins are special food used by our bodies to create muscles, bones and skin while pigments are natural colouring substances found in plants and animals.

The glow of the firefly functions like a light switch and is periodically turned on and off by the insect.

"Wondering what to do with wordless stories?

Wordless stories are wonderful because they contain infinite possibilities. Here are a few ideas for engaging with children using visual stories:

- Explore the story in a leisurely manner. Draw attention to the details - the expressions of the characters, setting, colours, etc. The idea is for each child to build her own story. If the story is being shown to a group of children, you could ask each of them to contribute a sentence or two for each illustration. Take joy in exploring each illustration and build the story as you go along.

- Use themes explored in the story to start a discussion. For instance, in this story, you could ask children about what they do for their birthday, or even how they help out at home.

- Encourage children to create 2-3 different stories using the same set of visuals. This will help push their imagination.",3,CC-BY,"Storyweaver, Pratham Books",,en,0338_the-birthday-party.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0338,pb

"Sarla liked to watch birds fly.

One day, during science class, she looked out of the window and saw an eagle gliding in the sky. How happy the bird must be! She also liked to see planes flying.

“Here, what's your name? Should you not be looking at the board?” asked the new teacher in Sarla's class.

Sarla got up hastily and said, “Sorry Madam, I was watching an eagle. I wish we could fly like a bird, or like an aeroplane....”

“What is your name?”

“Sarla.”",0,CC-BY,Aditi Sarawagi,,en,0348_how-do-aeroplanes-fly.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0348,pb
"“Oh how nice! Do you know that Sarla was the name of the first Indian women pilot too? My name, Hamsa, means a swan. Swans are one of the largest flying birds, you know,” said the teacher. “You must spend some time in the library, Sarla. I'm sure there are many books about birds and flights, and machines that fly like aeroplanes.”

Over the next few days, Sarla happily learnt a lot about birds, and about aeroplanes.",1,CC-BY,Aditi Sarawagi,,en,0348_how-do-aeroplanes-fly.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0348,pb
"Sarla learnt that human beings can fly too, but not like birds. We can fly to any city in the world in an aeroplane, one of mankind's greatest inventions.

With the help of this great machine, we can also experience the joy of being airborne. Birds are aerial creatures that do not need an external machine to fly. Usually, a bird's wings are bigger than the rest of its body. The wings are very light, making it possible for birds to fly.",2,CC-BY,Aditi Sarawagi,,en,0348_how-do-aeroplanes-fly.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0348,pb
"Aeroplanes are huge and very heavy. Just like birds, aeroplanes have wings on both their sides which help them to fly. The wings of the plane are shaped just like those of birds - curved on the top and flat on the bottom which helps them to fly high up in the sky.",3,CC-BY,Aditi Sarawagi,,en,0348_how-do-aeroplanes-fly.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0348,pb
"Birds flap their wings to fly, but of course we have never seen an aeroplane flapping its wings! Birds flap their wings as they use the wind to push their body upwards.

Aeroplanes also fly with the help of the force of the wind. This machine uses the engine inside its body to create wind that flows below the plane.",4,CC-BY,Aditi Sarawagi,,en,0348_how-do-aeroplanes-fly.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0348,pb
"An engine is a very strong machine which acts like the brain of the plane. Just like a bird uses its mind and logic to navigate its flight, engines help planes to push them above the ground and to help them move forward. When the plane's engines burn fuel, they release hot gases at high speeds which push on the air behind the engine, moving the plane forward.",5,CC-BY,Aditi Sarawagi,,en,0348_how-do-aeroplanes-fly.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0348,pb
"Cars and other vehicles with engines move forward too. But they cannot go up in the sky like planes. The wind flows over and under their wings which are shaped like birds' wings and lifts the plane into the sky and keeps it there.

Planes also have tails, just like birds, to keep them steady and help them change direction.

ٴ",6,CC-BY,Aditi Sarawagi,,en,0348_how-do-aeroplanes-fly.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0348,pb
"Planes need big long roads to take off and land. These long roads are called runways and planes need to travel very fast on the runway before they can take off into the air. Planes need to gain a lot of speed to lift off in the air.

Most aeroplanes can take off only if they are moving fast enough. The runway is an important part of the airport as it gives aeroplanes enough time to increase their speed and ultimately take off.",7,CC-BY,Aditi Sarawagi,,en,0348_how-do-aeroplanes-fly.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0348,pb
"Planes know where they have to go because they are steered by pilots. The pilots control the plane from a place in the front of the aeroplane called the cockpit. They keep in contact with the airport (a place from where the planes take off and land) through very accurate and modern devices. Just like there are signals and police to help us on the roads, there are air traffic controllers who tell pilots when and where to fly; and when it is safe to take off or land.

A plane is actually a giant bird. It is not only shaped like a bird, it also allows us to fly, though not like birds! Sarla wants to be a pilot and fly aeroplanes when she grows up.",8,CC-BY,Aditi Sarawagi,,en,0348_how-do-aeroplanes-fly.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0348,pb

"### Who Needs A Pet?

Anyone who wants a loving and loyal friend needs a pet. If you're feeling lonely and lost or mean and mad, a pet is sure to do something... anything to make you glad. A pet will play with you, make you feel better, teach you lots of important things, and bring endless fun into your life. Now, who doesn't want that?

### Should You Have A Pet Or Not?

Sure, pets are fun, but don't rush out to get one! Think carefully:

- Will your parents let you keep a pet?
- Do you really want a pet? Remember, a pet is for life. It is not a toy you can throw away once you get bored with it.
- Pets need food, clean water, exercise, and love. They also have to be trained, taken to the vet, and given baths. That means extra work, every single day. Do you have the time for that?
- Can you forgive your pet if it makes a mess with its muddy paws, or chews your favourite shoes?",16,CC-BY,Anupa Lal,,en,0360_reeti-and-mithu.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0360,pb
"### Am I Really Ready For A Pet?

Your best friend has a pet, and you wish you had one too! So you're wondering whether you should get a dog, a cat, or maybe, even a rat. Stop right there, before you pick a pet, and ask yourself these questions.

Do I have the time to take care of a pet?

Having a pet is a h-u-g-e responsibility. Whether it is for training, feeding or plain loving, you've got to spend time on your pet – big time!

### Do I Have Space At Home For A Pet?

Small pets like cats, fish and birds can adapt to houses of any size. But dogs may need more space to run around and exercise.",17,CC-BY,Anupa Lal,,en,0360_reeti-and-mithu.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0360,pb
"### What Kind Of Pet Do I Want?

If you want a specific kind of pet, talk to a vet or to people who own similar pets. Find out what they eat and how they behave. Then think hard about whether the pet will suit you.

### Can I Afford To Have A Pet?

All pets require food and shelter. Then, there are the visits to the vet for check-ups, vaccinations, and for treatment when the pet falls ill.

### Will A Pet Be Welcome At Home?

You may love animals, but do the rest of the family share your feelings? You need to talk this through with your family before you get a pet.",18,CC-BY,Anupa Lal,,en,0360_reeti-and-mithu.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0360,pb

A little wriggly crack appears on the egg and out pops the little one. Mama, with all the sweetness in her voice, calls her 'tiny foot!'

'It's really hot and dry here, Mama!', Tiny foot exclaimed. Every beautiful thing was destroyed because of the earthquake. Tiny foot and Mama decided to look-out for a new land. And so, they began their journey in search of marvellous new places.

'Exactly, smart you!'

She charges forward, then sharply swings her club-tail at the raptor with its teeth clamped on Mama, and gives a hard whack on his face. He flings in the air, out of sight. Watching this, the other raptor dashes off for cover.

"So they eagerly wait for their summer vacation. When the schools close on summer vacation, Rupa and her family of father, mother, brother and sister will take the train to travel to their ancestral home in the town of Murshidabad, where the twins live.

Murshidabad is a small town famous in West Bengal for the palace of Siraj Ud Daulla known all over as Hazar Duari. (thousand doors) The river Ganges flows by the river. The streets are wide and tree lined and the summer sun plays a glittering game of light and shade on the beautiful streets by the river and the town as a whole.",1,CC-BY,Bhasyati Sinha,,en,0367_rupa-s-vacation.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0367,pb
"Rupa feels excited about meeting her friends. There are lots of things to talk about, which is pent up in the last six months and of course she thought of all the games they play. She was so quiet sitting in a corner in the train, her mom was worried and asked her if she was feeling well. Rupa gave a broad smile and said she is quite alright and only thinking about Rini and Neha.

They reached in the evening, she met Rini and Neha, they had so much to talk about, so many rooms to roam around and so many people to hug.

There was her grandmother, and grandfather who greeted her with big kisses and a plate full of rasgullas. Then she met all her aunts and told them about her days in school. Finally the three friends took their dinner and went to a room, huddled together and went to sleep. They had already agreed that they would get up early in the morning and visit the fishes in the pond. This is how Rupa's vacation with her close friends started.

Her vacation means playing all through the morning after breakfast of parathas and alu bhaji. They will stop playing only when they feel hungry. After their lunch they would try to continue playing while their parents would insist that they get some rest. They would agree to rest only if their grandmother will tell them a story. They will fall asleep listening to grand-mother's fairy tale.

In the afternoon grandfather would call them aloud to take them to their farm. they would play in the farm with other children. grandfather would take them through the lush green fields of rice, pulses and mustard. They would play there along with the children of the farmers.",2,CC-BY,Bhasyati Sinha,,en,0367_rupa-s-vacation.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0367,pb
"by evening grandfather would bundle them up in his jeep and bring them back home. At home grandma would soak a brass bucket full of mangoes cut at the tips. when the children are back grandma would slice the mangoes and hand them over to the children. they will eat to their hearts content.

Ma will then call Rupa and the rest of the children for studies. they would study under her mother's guidance. after studies they would sit in the verandah for their dinner. they would sit on the ground on top of mats and food would be served by the aunties.",3,CC-BY,Bhasyati Sinha,,en,0367_rupa-s-vacation.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0367,pb
"Rupa would be so happy that she would not notice how the days passed by and it would be time to return to school in Calcutta.

It so happened that the day to go back arrived. The family got ready and it was time to leave for the station. Everybody got into the jeep, when Rupa's ma noticed that Rupa was missing . Everybody started looking for Rupa calling out her name.

"Rupa's mother started crying and nobody knew what could be done. It is already 1 O"" clock in the afternoon. It is getting late as they were supposed to catch the 2 O'clock train to Calcutta and they cannot possibly leave Rupa behind. Rupa's father said ""we will wait for Rupa and we will not go today"". the family trouped back into the house and everybody started looking for Rupa in earnest.

Suddenly Rini found Rupa peeping out from behind the cowshed. She asked Rini 'Is it 2 O clock yet?'

Then as the clock struck 2 she came out of her hiding place. Rini asked Rupa 'why are you hiding?' Rupa said ""I dont want to go. I want to stay another day. I hid to miss the train.",5,CC-BY,Bhasyati Sinha,,en,0367_rupa-s-vacation.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0367,pb

"On the rose bush, Anty, the little black ant was playing with her friends. She caught hold of a leaf and climbed down. Some of her friends called her ‘brave' while some whispered ‘she is mad'.

Anty reached the edge of the leaf and looked up. All appeared upside down. She could see only the bobbing heads of her friends.

Delighted, she raised her head higher and cupped her hands to shout, “Hurray!”

She lost balance and fell straight down. Her head spinning, in fright, she shut her eyes tightly.

Anty fell on a ball of fur and opened her eyes slowly. Brown hair was spread all over. Wondering where she was, she parted strands of hair and peeked out. A black long stick grabbed her instantly.

“You silly ant, you spoiled my sleep,” growled Browny, the squirrel.

He threatened to smash her. Anty's mother saw her falling down and dashed to her rescue. She pleaded with the raging squirrel to forgive Anty.

Anty was lucky, as that day Browny was in a good mood. He pitied them and let go of Anty.

Her mother whisked her away. Anty yelled back, “Browny, I will help you one day.”

Anty's mother dragged her hurriedly into the burrow and Browny chuckled at the little ant's courage. Her friends admired her heroism while her mother warned her to be wary of the squirrel.

Two months later, the ants got busy collecting and storing food in their den for the cold winters. Anty and her friends joined their families to gather food. The younger ants were full of energy and wandered far in search of food.

Anty made up a song –

“Hurray Hurray, Merry Merry!

March March, left and right!

Up the hill and down the hill, we go in a line;

East and West, we run in quest;

North and South, we search for grub;

Hurray Hurray, Merry Merry!

March March, left and right!”

Anty and her friends sang at the top of their voice. The older ants were pleased. Anty saw Browny snoring under a tree. She was curious to know why the squirrel didn't collect food like them. But she did not dare to ask him.

The winters were bitter. All the ants rested in their cosy dens. One day, Anty heard a deep moan. She wanted to find out from where it came, but her mother scolded her for prying. Anty pretended to sleep. Once her mother fell asleep, she followed the sound of the moan. It came from outside the oak tree. Browny was shivering with cold at the foot of the oak. His eyes were closed and he appeared to be in pain.

Anty went back into the den and woke up her friends. Together, they thought and thought. They dug a deep burrow and filled it with dry leaves. Now, they had a problem. How will the little ants push the big squirrel into the warm dugout?

Anty said – ‘all of us must push at the same time.' Her friends agreed. And like a leader, she shouted at the top of her voice, “Ready! Set! Go!” At the word go, the ants pushed the squirrel. Browny tumbled into the burrow. They covered him with dry grass.

Browny opened his eyes after a day. Anty and her friends were happy that the squirrel got well and gave him peanuts to eat. The squirrel was grateful and nicknamed them - Anty's team. They became friends.",0,CC-BY,Annapurna Sharma,,en,0368_anty-s-team.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0368,pb

Author's Note

--------------------

Books are an ideal gift for young readers..

Books instill strong feelings of confidence, courage and happiness in young minds.

They take them into a magical world where humans can fly, animals can talk, robots can sing and aliens can dance.

A few tips to instill reading habit in your child/children:

______________________________________________________________

1. Pamper your child or your children with books relevant to their age.

2. Talk to your child/children about the importance of reading books.

3. Spend at least 15-20 minutes of each day reading a book to your child or children.

4. Make a reading nook in your home, grab a book, one for yourself, one for your child and read together. If a dedicated reading nook is not possible, make any and every place your reading nook - on the bed, in center of your living room and even under the dining table :)

5. Take your child or children to Public Libraries and help them to choose/pick a book for reading.

6. Take them for story sessions happening in your locality once in a while.

7. Importantly, talk to them about the book they read.

Thanks!

"Basha stares at her. How does Sainabi work out those numbers so quickly in her head? ""That's right,"" he says gruffly, measuring out the rice into a big vessel. ""Now, why don't you tell me how much we need of all the other ingredients too, and I will tell you if you are right.""

""Sure, Bhai!"" says Sainabi, running to get a pencil and paper. She loves it when her brother involves her in something he is doing. As Basha tells her the list of ingredients needed for four people, she calculates the quantities for 24.

""15 green beans for 4 people,"" calls out Basha.

""That means... 15 x 6 = 90 green beans for 24!"" says Sainabi.

""3/4 cup of curd for 4 people.""

""That means 3/4 x 6 = 0.75 x 6 = 4.5 cups of curd for 24,"" says Sainabi, working it out on her paper quickly. ""I hope we have that much curd in the fridge.""

"“Can you help me with the chopping too?” Basha asks, realizing that there are a lot of vegetables to be chopped.

“Of course, Bhai,” grins Sainabi. Today is her lucky day!

Basha first soaks the fine orange strands of saffron in milk and the rice in water. He then joins Sainabi in chopping the vegetables. Then he turns on the stove and starts roasting the spices - cinnamon, cloves, green cardamoms, black cardamoms - and all the chopped vegetables, in ghee.

The familiar pleasant aromas of good food start to fill the house. Basha starts to gain confidence in himself. He can't wait to get to his favourite part now - layering and slow-cooking the half-cooked rice, spices and vegetables in a handi.

As Basha sets up the handi and starts to slow-cook it on the tawa, the doorbell rings.

“Surprise!” shout Basha and Sainabi as they whip the lid off the handi. Ammi is stunned.

“Basha is a great cook, Ammi. He has made biryani! I helped him make it,” Sainabi says. Basha smiles proudly at Ammi, thinking that his little sister is not so bad after all.

Ammi hugs Basha and Sainabi. ""Mashallah!"" she smiles. ""I have two really fine kids. I am so proud of you both.""

""Why don't you join Saira aunty and the others, Ammi?"" says Basha. ""Sainabi and I will serve you all."" Sainabi nods eagerly. Maybe Bhai will ask her to help him with more things from now on! She can't stop smiling at the thought.

“This is the best Dum Biryani we've ever had!” say Saira aunty and her friends.

"6. Take the pan off the stove and add mint and coriander leaves into it.

7. In a separate pan, boil the water. Add the rest of the salt, black cardamoms and the green cardamoms.

8. Drain the soaked rice, add it to the boiling water, and cook for 8 minutes with the pan uncovered. When the rice is almost cooked, drain it through a colander* . 9. In a handi** whose size is just right to hold the biryani, begin layering. In Layer 1, put 1/3rd of the cooked vegetable mix (from step 5) and 1/3rd of the cashews and raisins. In Layer 2, put 1/3rd of the cooked rice (step 8), topped with 1/3rd of the fried onions (step 1) and 1/3rd of saffron milk. Keep alternating Layers 1 and 2 until you have six layers.
10. Cover the handi and place it on a hot tava. Cook for 5 minutes on a medium flame and another 7 minutes on a low flame.
11. Remove the handi from the stove and mix the biryani until the colours of the spices are uniformly distributed.

"Are you a food math wiz?
Can you cook up a delicious biryani for 24 like Basha did? No? Never mind. Maybe you can help him calculate the quantities of various ingredients he needs, like Sainabi did. Go on, try it!

1. If Basha needs 1 onion for a biryani for 4 people, how many will he need for a biryani for 24 people?
2. If Basha needs 72 florets of cauliflower for biryani that serves 24, how many florets should he put into a biryani that serves 3?
3. If the recipe says to put in 3/4 cups of curd for a biryani for 6 people, how much curd should we put into a biryani for 48 people?
4. To make biryani for 5 people, you need 4 tbsp of ghee. If Basha puts in 32 tbsps, how many people is he cooking for?

My grandfather is always going on about how much the world has changed since he was my age, back in 2016. It's more crowded now, but the air, thankfully, is less polluted, because a great many vehicles now run on electricity or solar power. There are fewer accidents too, because vehicles drive themselves, and they are very careful. There are fewer trees and forests than there used to be, but more are being planted all the time, which is good.

But what has REALLY changed, says my grandfather, is technology. There was technology way back in 2016 too, but nothing like what we have now. it has truly made life wonderful.

I see your eyes pop. Ha! You hadn't guessed that, had you? But think about it. Which other friend would cheerfully build you a tower 50 times over without complaining? And which other friend would build it so perfectly every single time?

Bonda: I agree! Humans are simply not as accurate or as consistent as we are. And they complain that doing the same thing over and over is “boring” (I've no idea what that word means, so don't ask me!). And they fall ill, and need to go to the toilet a lot.

First, I directed Bonda to the shelf it was sitting on, drawing the route on the plan of my house he displays on his touchscreen.

### Robots: Yesterday, Today And Tomorrow

Will there be a Bonda for every Devi by the year 2085? We'll have to wait and see, but there is no denying that robots will be far more visible even in 25 years from now, by the year 2040.

### Who Or What Is A Robot?

If you said a robot is a machine that looks and acts like a human, except it moves jerkily, has a flat, expressionless voice, and eyes that flash when it is turned on, you've obviously been watching too many movies and TV shows. Because, actually, a robot is “any electro-mechanical machine guided by a computer program or electronic circuits"". Yup, it doesn't have to look like a human at all. Which is why you may not have realised that there are robots all around us, already!

### Really? Where?

Well, they are in factories, warehouses, orchards, hospitals and even homes. They may look like large mechanical arms, like the ones in car manufacturing plants, welding, gluing and painting car parts. Or they may look like tiny cameras, like the ones in hospitals, attached to thin hair-like tubes, entering our intestines and arteries to check them out for problems. Some robots look like flat round discs, working in homes and offices, buzzing around and cleaning floors at night when everyone is asleep. Some look like small wheeled vehicles, going into war zones, finding dangerous landmines, or rolling across the surfaces of the moon or Mars, taking pictures and collecting samples to send to scientists back on Earth.",15,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0380_bonda-and-devi.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0380,pb
"### I Wish I Could See A Robot For Myself!

If you have ever used, or even seen, a computer or a smartphone, you have 'seen' a robot! Yes, they are in those devices as well. Some of them even have names, like Siri and Cortana (have you heard of them?). They can help us find useful information - stuff for school projects, traffic reports (which roads have heavy traffic today? What is a good alternative route to take?), entertainment (where is the new Deepika Padukone movie running? And when is the next show?), and much more. They can even book our bus and train tickets, order our groceries, and tell us exactly how many calories we have burnt after a game of football.

### What Does The Future Of Robots Look Like? What Will The World Really Be Like By, Say, 2040, As Far As Robots Are Concerned?

We may not have robots walking our streets in India by 2040, but we will definitely be surrounded by robots of one kind or another without knowing it. It is quite likely that there will be driverless “robot” cars on our streets. We may have microscopic robots in our contact lenses that help us take pictures – we won't even have to hold our phones or cameras up to take them (but how will we take selfies??). And little airborne robots called drones will be flying busily all around – delivering letters, packages and kababs, putting delivery boys out of business, and hopefully reducing some traffic on our streets! As for 2085, 45 years AFTER that, who knows what robots will be up to?",16,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0380_bonda-and-devi.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0380,pb

Vaidya sobbed, looking greener than usual. “They cut down the tree that was my home. Now I don't know where to go,” he cried.

Baankey, Dipu and other animals also popped out of their homes. Vaidya was homeless.

“A new, concrete road is going to be built and humans cut down my tree,” wailed Vaidya.

"“We must help Vaidya,” said Gopa.

Fatima, Gopa and their new friends formed a search party. They searched and searched and found a snug tree-hole home for Vaidya. Fatima layered the home with soft leaves and orange flowers, Vaidya's favourite colour.

Vaidya loved his new home. “I can't believe I have so many friends! We need to have a party,” he said.",17,CC-BY,Padmaparna Ghosh,,en,0391_up-world-down-world.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0391,pb

"Meet Fatima's Friends in the Up World

Gopa and her friends live in the vast forest canopies of India. That means they don't live in the Down World, like us human beings. Instead they live in the Up World, in the swinging branches and swaying leaves of trees.

Many creatures that live in forest canopies are now used to living in tree tops. If you're lucky you will spot some of them, but most of these animals know how to hide themselves cleverly. So you have to be patient!

When scientists go to learn about these canopies, they have to use ropes or ladders, because the trees are very tall. Some even use very large hot-air balloons to get up there. You can imagine just how Up Fatima had to go with her balloons.",19,CC-BY,Padmaparna Ghosh,,en,0391_up-world-down-world.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0391,pb

Malabar spiny dormouse: This bushy-tailed animal likes to live in trees in quiet, undisturbed forests. It loves to eat fruits and nibbles on pepper sometimes. This dormouse sleeps like a hedgehog, curled up with its tail protruding OUT.

Hornbill: These birds are vividly coloured with long and strong beaks. These sociable birds love to eat fruits, insects and even small animals. They make nests in holes in trees and when they have babies, they make a mud wall to cover up the hole, much like making a house!",20,CC-BY,Padmaparna Ghosh,,en,0391_up-world-down-world.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0391,pb
"Green vine snake: A bright green, slender tree snake that hides in the leaves of a canopy. It moves very slowly. You can find them not only in India but also Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.

Tree frog: There are several kinds of tree frogs and they come in various colours. They can have white lips or red or yellow eyes and brown feet. They are usually very small, half the size of your palm, because they have to jump around delicate branches. They spend most of their lives up in the trees.

Fruit bat (aka Megabat): They hang upside down. Try to imagine what the world looks like to them! They love to eat fruits and being busy in the trees. They can be super noisy too. You can hear them from a long way off. They have keen senses of sight and smell and are very helpful to us because they pollinate the flowers and fruits we love.",21,CC-BY,Padmaparna Ghosh,,en,0391_up-world-down-world.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0391,pb

"Oli Tagore was ten years old. She loved football. Rebecca Collins was her best friend. She was eleven years old. These two used to play in a football team called 'Goal'. There were only three girls in the team – Oli, Rebecca and another girl called Anna. The boys were Harry, Allen, Louis, Alex, Liam, Niall, Jacob and Oli's twin, Boom. One day Boom started singing a very silly song...

Boom said, ''I don't know.'' Rebecca said, ''Wow, new coach, woohoo!'' Then she ran around the field and hugged a light pole and said, ''I hope its a woman.'' Then a colourful car drove up on the driveway, the door opened and a woman with two extra large backpacks came out. She said, ''I am Helen, your new football coach. Is this the team, Goal?'' Alex said, ''Yo, sure we are!'' Then Boom whispered into Oli's ear, ''Too much lipstick, Mommy's going to hate her.'' The coach said, “Don't call me coach, call me Helen.

"Mani put his Schoolbag down on the Coffee Table and groaned. His shoulders hurt, but his head hurt even more. It had been a long day. The Amulet around his neck flashed once.

“Are you not feeling well, Manikantan?” asked the Room.

“I'm fine. Leave me alone.”

Mani moved the Amulet to the back of his neck. He longed to throw it into the Trash. The objects in the House would still be able to spy on him but at least they wouldn't be able to talk to him.

“You groaned twice.” The Room's voice sounded muffled. “Do you have a headache, Manikantan?”

“Leave me alone.” Then after a pause, Mani added, “Yes.”

“Tsk, tsk. So sorry to hear that, Manikantan.” The Room sounded very sympathetic. “I have let your Amma know. Perhaps you are hungry. That may be why you're having a headache.

“Yes,” said the ShoeRack, “I have plenty of space. Waiting.”

Mani knew he should get up, but he didn't feel like it. Maybe he should just sleep a little. He was so tired.

“Waiting,” said the ShoeRack.

"“Waiting,” said the ShoeRack.

Mani sat up with a sigh. He didn't mind being given helpful hints, but this was too much. It was almost like being a prisoner and nobody, not even Amma, understood. Mani placed the Shoes on the ShoeRack and headed for the Kitchen.

He had to warm the pakodas himself, but the FoodGenie brewed some chai. It tasted exactly like the kind of chai a machine would make.

He knew the House would report to his mother that her son was crying. Everything he did was watched and reported. He knew it was all for his own good and he knew Amma loved him, but sometimes, he wanted things to be.

He closed his finger around the Amulet, and pulled the chain so hard, it snapped. Mani threw the Amulet into the Trash, and ignoring its shouting, ran out of the apartment.

After his mother had thanked the nice policeman who brought him back, Mani took the Amulet from her. He was ashamed but also really glad to be back.

“I have adjusted some of the settings,” said his mother. “The House will now give you a little more privacy. But it is really for your own good, Mani.”

“I know,” mumbled Mani.

“So how was it, your little adventure?”

Mani shuddered. The streets had been filled with people but they were all somehow different. They were all strangers. With the Amulet, the streets were filled with many people he almost knew.

"Without the Amulet even simple things, like crossing the streets, had become difficult. There was no voice to tell him: “You can cross now, Manikantan.” And nobody knew him either.

When he had passed the poster for the movie 'Mission Maut', the hero of the movie Vikram Seven said: “Hi, do you like action movies?”

"“I thought so,” said his mother, with a small smile. “Now Mani, you know you shouldn't have left the House without the Amulet? We were so worried!”

“I'm sorry I broke the rules, Amma.”

“That's not always a bad thing, kanna. But you are a big boy now. You have to be more mature. Our life here is pretty happy, na?”

Mani thought of Anandpuram. An Amulet would be pretty useless in Anandapuram. Maybe that wasn't such a good thing. He nodded.

"The Internet of Things

Does your alarm clock know that you have exams tomorrow? Will it remind you to set the alarm so that you can get up early to do a final revision? If you are going somewhere and get lost, can your shoes give step-by-step directions? Of course not.

Today, most of the objects we are surrounded are just objects. They don't really know anything about you or the objects in the house. The clock is just a clock. The radio is just a radio. The clock does not know what the radio does and vice versa. They are not connected to you or to other people or to the objects in the world.

But things are about to change. Soon, all human-made objects will be interconnected. They will be more aware of what is going on around them. They will be smarter. They will be able to exchange data and keep track of your needs in a better way. When objects get interconnected and can communicate with each other, as if by an invisible telephone network, we say we have an Internet of Things.

"In time, the bamboo took root and began to grow. As it grew, it brought shade, and the shade brought insects.

The insects burrowed into the ground, and the earth below the bamboo trees began to change. The dry and white became rich and brown, and the dead sand became living soil.

Jadav was no longer sad. But he wasn't happy either.

He looked around his bamboo grove and thought, ""A few-trees-place is nice, I know.

But how wonderful it would be if this were a many-trees-place!"" The idea thrilled him.

At the age of 16, distressed by the sight of dying snakes that had washed up on a sandbar banking the Brahmaputra, Jadav decided to plant some trees in the spot. He started small, with bamboos, and grew an entire forest, plant by painstaking plant. This was back in 1979.

Over the next three decades, Jadav and his tree-planting have managed to change the soil in the barren area. The 550-hectare sandbar is now a lush, dense forest and home to a variety of flora and fauna, including elephants, tigers, apes, deer and many species of local and migratory birds. Jadav continues to visit and nurture his forest every day, planting wherever he finds empty patches.",17,CC-BY,Vinayak Varma,,en,0397_jadav-and-the-tree-place.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0397,pb
"Growing Up With a Mango Tree:

a Tree-Planting Activity

Just ate a mango? Loved it? Want another? You can go to a shop and buy one, of course. But it's a lot more fun (and free!) to use the seed of the mango you just ate and make a few fruits of your own. All you need is time and patience.

First, find a nice patch of empty land near your house. Get a friend, sibling or grown-up to help you plant the seed you saved in that patch. Make sure the soil is loose and there's plenty of sun. It may take several weeks of waiting, watering and watching before your seed turns into a plant, so don't worry and definitely don't hurry.

Once your seed germinates and grows into a healthy mango plant, get ready for a lot more waiting, watering and watching. Take care that your plant doesn't get eaten up by insects or animals, or get stepped on by someone. If all this waiting is making you feel bored, read a few books, sing some songs, and plant some more plants!

After a few years, as you grow taller, your mango plant will grow tall with you, until it becomes a big tree that you can climb and picnic under. This is when the real fun begins. By now, your tree will have started making its own mangoes, which you and your friends can eat. Even better, those mangoes will soon start attracting other mango-loving creatures to your tree: birds, ants, squirrels, bats, monkeys, spiders and lots more.

Some of these creatures will come to eat the fruit, some will come to feed on the tree's sap, some to drink nectar from its flowers, and some creatures will even come to eat some of the other creatures hanging around the tree. But it's not all about eating. Some creatures may come just to rest in your tree's shade, or to take a nap in its branches. Your tree has many different uses for every different creature!

Spend some time every day watching who visits your mango tree, at which time of the day they come, and what they do. Write down what you see in your notebook. Also draw pictures of what you see.

See how much you've done and learned with just one mango seed? Isn't tree-planting fun? Now imagine how much fun Jadav must have had planting his entire forest full of trees!",18,CC-BY,Vinayak Varma,,en,0397_jadav-and-the-tree-place.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0397,pb

"The Messy Desk

It was a damp morning and I was sitting inside watching the rain drops splash onto the sand making it wet and slushy to walk on. I took a glance at my desk...The messiest desk ever! I walked over to it and drew a big sigh and to my great, great, great astonishment, a little ant came up and talked to me! She started out as, “Yuck!”, big welcome speech, I know, right? “Not

even an ant can live in this “paradise” if she can't live without a wasp or a roach knocking on her door, just waiting to devour her!”, she spat out in disgust. “Um...Who are you?”, I demanded, nervously hoping she wouldn't have super-natural powers and turn me into some garden lizard. “Oh! where are my manners? I'm Cheenu, the sixth ant of the fifth column, fifty second row, thirty fifth line and ...” “Come on, give me a break! Term holidays just started!”, I thought to myself, getting annoyed at the thought of another math lecture. “And who may you be, oh, four feet tall giant who is standing before me?”, she questioned dramatically. “Oh...I'm Ananya...One millionth person you'd expect to be talking to an ant in this world.”, I murmured, praying fervently that she wouldn't whip out a gun and declare that I was her greatest enemy, like Buzz Lightyear did to Woody in Toy Story 3. “Nice to meet you, Ananya!”, she answered warmly motioning me to shake her antenna.

In a minute, she was scurrying across my desk muttering something that sounded like this, “We'll need that thrown away...Ah, yes, a vase here and maybe just a little penholder thing over there, ooh! And a nice little pin-up board on top to remind you to not mess up your desk again. There, perfecto!”. Suddenly, I felt a bright bluish green light grip me and before I knew it, I was whisked away to some unknown land!At first, I was scared, but, when I looked around I just forgot to scream my head off and run away into the horizon. The sky was the brightest blue I had ever seen, the soil was smooth and warm unlike the harsh concrete floor I had been used to, I could smell tulips and lavenders in the fresh air blowing across my face, the crocuses were lovely to just gaze at, the clouds were as white as a brand new layer of snow, the sun shone brightly like a ball of gold. It was breathtaking to behold nature in such a beautiful way!

Then and there, I knew that I would never forget this bright blue sky I had seen today. “Enjoying the scenery, are we?”, asked Cheenu, interrupting my pleasant thoughts. “Why have you brought me here?”, I demanded, purposely ignoring her question. “Oh, only because of your desk...”, deliberately letting her voice trail off. “What does this have to do with my desk?”, I questioned, even though I wasn't really surprised. “The only reason why I brought you hear was because there's a clean desk competition held by our mayor, King Antie Anty Anter Antag Anta Anten Antem Antman Antan.”, she replied. “Mr. Antie Anter -wait, what?”, I asked, seriously confused. “We call him King Nine A's.”, she said, smirking at my “slow” thinking process. “Okay...I think.”, I said, a bit unsurely.”Anyways, we have to go enter you into the competition!”, she cried anxiously and grabbed my hand and made me run to wherever she was taking me.

“Here we are!”, she cried, sounding a bit nervous but at the same time delighted. I looked up and saw a huge anthill in sitting in front of my eyes, but, this wasn't a normal two feet anthill you'd see on a jungle trek! This anthill was taller than the tallest skyscraper in the world and looked like a fairytale castle, that too, with the most vibrant colors I had ever seen!Cheenu, literally, had to pull me inside as I was so awe-struck by this humongous building made by such tiny things of which we don't take any notice in our lives. When I entered the anthill, or rather the castle, I saw thick red carpets strewn on the floor, portraits and photographs of very posh looking ant ladies with beehive hair-dos, ant sports jocks in sweatshirts with bandanas on their pimple sized heads, ant duchesses and dukes in princely robes holding scepters and curtsying , and old ant grannies in babushkas. I looked ahead and saw an ant dressed in flowing robes, his hair slightly greying, sitting on a throne, holding a scepter
in his right hand and the other hand

cautiously moving to his decorated sword hilt, with a wise look on his face. “Greetings Your Royal Antiness! I have come from the sixth house on Antsfort Avenue in the Desk of Danger and Disgustingness to enter Ananya, um, I mean, this human, standing beside me, into the Desk Competition on the fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the fifth century, um, I mean twenty first century!”, she announced proudly and a bit nervously, bowing down before King Nine A's. “Rise Cheenu, ant from the sixth house on Antsfort Avenue! This human will be allowed to participate in the fourth competition of all ants from the Desk of Danger and Disgustingness which is on the fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the twenty first century!”, he declared grandly. “Yes!”, both of us chorused, slapping a high-five onto each other's palm/sole.

When we got back to the human world the first thing I did was stare at my desk for about a millionth of a second before exclaiming, “Cheenu! The fifth of June is tomorrow! How am I supposed to clear this up in one afternoon and evening put together?!”. She simply smiled and let a shrill whistle escape from her lips. I thought that I would be looking at every single dog in the country, the next minute. But instead, every single bird and insect were hopping onto my “oh so messy” desk. “Tweet, tweet! What can we do for you?”, asked one of the sparrows, curtsying cheerfully. “All you have to do is clear up and decorate “Madame Messy's” desk.”, she replied, glancing so sternly at me that I started to shift uncomfortably, ashamed of my “cleanliness”. “Ooh! I love cleaning things up!”, cried out a few beetles and spiders. “Great! Now, let's not be desk potatoes, and get some work done!”, said Cheenu, encouragingly. “Huzzah! Huzzah! It is time do something! Huzzah! Huzzah! But, hide when the telephones go ‘

tring'! Huzzah! Huzzah! We love cleaning up! Huzzah! Huzzah!None of us are lazy grumps!”, they all chimed into what was, probably, their “Clean up, clean up, everybody clean up!”. “In a few extremely short hours my desk was the most “natural” looking desk on earth! Mrs. Chibby and Mrs. Chuzzette, the lovely old spiders spun detailed spider webs on the top and corners of my desk, Amanda and Miranda, the weavers, had built pen holders out of their funky nest material and John and Gabby, the beetles, had made glow-in the-dark paper ball lamps hanging from the top! It was awesome and I seriously wished that I had thought of taking a snap using the photo booth app in my laptop!

The next day, we presented it and got second place, because some brainy ant computer jock had made a desk out of a computer and attached automatic iTunes to it. But still, I was the winner in the eyes of the cool beetles, wasps, ants, sparrows, parrots and macaws who helped me. Later, as usual, we had to say goodbye. I almost cried like a baby, that day! Cheenu bid a silent farewell and entered her home on Antsfort Avenue in the Desk of Dazzlement and Daintiness. She still visits me every now and then and we take crazy selfies and have some fun during those special moments. Who knows? You might be the next one to find yourself talking to an ant!",0,CC-BY,Ananya Ganesh,,en,0403_the-messy-desk.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0403,pb
"The Mango Pickle
It was a bright morning and the sun was shining, it seemed as if absolutely nothing could go wrong when, ‘Tring, tring, tring, tring!', the telephone rang. Papa picked it up and answered. “Hello?”, he said. “Is this Ramesh?”, came a gruff voice, and, almost immediately, a frown spread across Papa's face. “Anna! Would you like anything?”, he asked, suddenly becoming polite and, instantly, I knew who it was, it was Mahesh Uncle, Papa's most feared elder brother

who always managed to find fault in things no matter what. “I have some work to do in Chennai and I don't want to stay in one of those cheap hotels where they make the curry too spicy and the curd too sour. So, I want to stay in your house for two days, is that alright?”, Mahesh Uncle continued. “O-Of course, Anna!”, Papa replied, he was trembling all over, by now. “Good. Thank you!”, he answered and put the receiver down. “Gauri! Gauri! Anna's coming to stay tomorrow!”, he yelled, running into the kitchen where Ma was making dosas and chutney. “What?!But, that means I have to make your mother's spicy mango pickle that he loves!”, Ma cried out, who knew Mahesh Uncle was so hard to please? “Arre!Just find the recipe and make it!”, Papa answered, trying to make it sound like it was the easiest thing to do. “But, the maid accidentally threw it out, two months ago!”, Ma yelled back, frantically pacing back and forth until she realized that the dosa on the pan had become burnt. “Then go ask Shalini Akka!”, Papa
retorted, literally stomping out of the kitchen, by the way, Shalini Akka was the launderer who was always humming whenever she was seen with a heavy bag of dirty clothes on her head.

When we were just sitting down for lunch, Ma saw her strolling down the street humming one of her usual tunes. “Shalini Akka! Shalini Akka, wait!”, Ma called out from the balcony, waving her hands wildly. “Who called me?”, she wondered out loud and looked up at Ma. She was at our door, before you can blow out your birthday candles. “What happened, Amma?”, she asked innocently looking around. “Do you know how to make mango pickle?”, Ma almost screamed, desperately. I think Shalini Akka, who's hearing and eyesight was not to good since she was a bit old, heard as mango halwa. She quickly dropped her laundry bag at the doorstep and walked into the kitchen. She put all kinds of things into it while Ma sat on the sofa muttering thankfully.

Here is the list of the ingredients Shalini Akka put into our delicious mango halwa:

* freshly chopped up mangoes

* salt (she thought it was sugar)

* peas (she thought they were cardamoms)

* salty butter milk (she thought it was milk)

* a stack of cheese (she thought it was butter)

Shalini Akka walked out beaming with pride and happily dusting her hands. Ma didn't even look at it before closing the jar with a lid. After one hour, Ma started to fret. “Shalini Akka has an uncontrollable sweet tooth. What if she made it too sweet? Mahesh Anna won't like that. I'll call Mrs. Vohra from next door to check if it's too sweet and fix it if it is.”. In five minutes, Ms. Vohra, our neighbor, came and opened the pot while Ma was glamouring herself for a friend's wedding. Mrs. Vohra was inexperienced when it came to the art of cooking and didn't realize that it was actually mango halwa, only that this mango “pickle” was too sweet like Ma had thought. Immediately, she got down to work, here are the ingredients she put into our mango “pickle”:

* sliced green mangoes

* hot chili powder

* whole chillies

* salt

Done! Another version of our mango pickle was completed! The moment Mrs. Vohra left, she left Ma in a pensive mood. “What if she made it too spicy? Mrs. Vohra loves spice what if she put extra spice into it? Mahesh Anna won't like that either. Let me ask Mr. Rastogi to come and check if it's okay.”, she thought out loud and her hands flew to the telephone. In one second, the doorbell rang. And in an old man came shuffling with a sturdy wooden stick held firmly in his wrinkled hand. Mr. Rastogi was old and experienced in cooking but, unfortunately, his hearing and sight weren't as good as his hands. Next minute, he was in the kitchen stirring and chopping and adding every single ingredient, here is exactly what he added:

* bitter gourd (he probably thought it was an oversized green chili)

* ketchup (he probably thought it was chili sauce)

* green bell pepper (he probably thought it was a green mango)

And yet, another version of our mango pickle was completed! He went away with a triumphant grin on his face, seriously, I thought that his jaws would break if he smiled any longer!Ma put it in the fridge and crossed her fingers for the very best. Next afternoon, Mahesh Uncle arrived. His “grand” entrance was made by yelling at the taxi driver for placing the fare too high, while the poor driver was shivering from head to toe. “Hello, Mahesh Anna!”, Papa greeted him, putting on a polite tone, while Ma stood behind him with her hands folded respectfully. “Is lunch ready? Have you made mango pickle?”, he demanded, deliberately ignoring both of them. “Yes, Anna. Please have a seat.”, Ma gestured him towards the dining table. Later, Ma brought the mango pickle and served it with curd rice. I hoped fervently that he wouldn't storm off and

declare that he would never come back. Ma produced a shiny silver spoon for Uncle to use. He scooped half a spoon of the mango “pickle” and shoved it into his mouth. And then, came the unexpected reaction that I hadn't even dared to hope would happen. “Mmm!Delicious! Superb! This is the best mango pickle I've ever tasted in ages! I don't really think I want my mother's mango pickle anymore, ah, yes! From now on, you will make only this mango pickle and nothing else!”, he beamed at all of us, while, shoving another spoonful of the “pickle” in his mouth. Oh My God! Who could ever like such a thing! Then again, instead of complaining, I should be thankful he didn't box Pa's ears. Maybe you should try this recipe!

Do you know what happened yesterday? Gaurav, Ali and two of their friends from Class VII cornered me after school to ask about you-know-what. They took my bag and wouldn't give it back.

To be really honest, I can't say I'm not curious myself or that I don't have the same questions the others are asking me. Yes, I noticed it the first day when you came into the classroom. I saw how you did everything with one hand and how your left hand never moved. At first I couldn't tell what the problem was. Then, when I came closer, I saw that something wasn't quite right.

Why don't you play with us? Why don't you come on the swing? Everyone loves the swing. It's been two weeks, and you can jolly well come by yourself. I am not going to be your minder for ever.

Do you know what a coincidence is? It's like when you talk about something and the same thing happens sometime later in a completely unrelated way.

In my last letter, I was telling you about Sumi and the shoelaces, and then, today, I saw you tying your shoelaces. Wow, that was awesome! I think you did it faster than I can do it with two hands. If you were my friend, I would challenge you to a shoelace-tying race. Or no, maybe I would ask you to teach me how to do it with one hand.

I have to confess, I did try to tie my shoelace with one hand when I got home. But it's impossible. How do you do it? Maybe I'll ask you tomorrow.

"Hi,

So, after what you said, I've tried to do a lot of things with only one hand, but it's so difficult! I still don't get how you do it, like having a bath, wearing your clothes, packing your bag. Since that day at lunch, I did realize that you have to do some things differently, but it's not like you don't do almost everything the rest of us do.

Listen, I'm sorry about what I said earlier... about playing with us. I guess you were just feeling shy. And also about coming on the swing. I tried and it's hard to get your balance if you don't hold it with two hands. But you're great in the jungle gym, even if you don't hang from the bars, and you can run really fast, even faster than Ali, who won the first prize at Sports Day.

"Hello!

That movie was really funny, no? I laughed so much that my stomach hurt and it was like I was crying. I always like it when they show movies in school. It means no classes.

Last time, before you came to our school, they showed this movie about a tiger cub who got lost. It was quite scary, mostly because it was a true story. Later someone found it and managed to get it back to its family. True stories like that are called documentaries, did you know that? Tiger cubs are cute, no?

Jamun lived in a pretty little house perched on top of a cliff.,0,CC-BY,Vibhy Batra,,en,0407_jamun-has-her-wish.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0407,pb
"One fine morning, she looked out of the window and felt unbearably sad. The day had dawned nice and bright, and here she was, stuck at home. You see, Jamun was recovering from a recent illness, a particularly nasty bout of fever.

Her doctor, a stern man with an unruly mop of curly hair had given her strict instructions: no mischief, plenty of rest.",1,CC-BY,Vibhy Batra,,en,0407_jamun-has-her-wish.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0407,pb
"So what if she couldn't go outside. Her thoughts certainly could. She closed her eyes and imagined herself out in the open, surrounded by lovely pink flowers, birds chirping away merrily. Just thinking about them made her smile.

Oh, how she wished she could be out, too!",2,CC-BY,Vibhy Batra,,en,0407_jamun-has-her-wish.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0407,pb

What use did she have for books and lessons when she had grandpa? Her patient, loving, knowledgeable grandpa. He knew all that there was to know and Jamun simply loved listening to him.",3,CC-BY,Vibhy Batra,,en,0407_jamun-has-her-wish.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0407,pb
"When she couldn't make head or tail of something at school, she turned to Grandpa.

When her teacher scolded her for not paying attention, she ran to Grandpa.

With his kind words and encouraging smile, Grandpa always made her tears disappear in a flash.

So, when she expressed a desire to go outside, he had an idea!",4,CC-BY,Vibhy Batra,,en,0407_jamun-has-her-wish.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0407,pb

"Jamun wasn't too sure about it.

What would her friends say, she wondered.

"Grandpa being Grandpa had idea ready.

He wheeled Jamun out and headed straight to school.

On the way, they met Chinkoo.

He was rather taken aback at the sight.

What was Jamun doing in that strange looking thing.",7,CC-BY,Vibhy Batra,,en,0407_jamun-has-her-wish.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0407,pb
"Reading his thoughts, Grandpa sounded the prayer wheel. Clinggggggg!

Chinkoo looked at it with great interest.

""Lucky me, I got this prayer wheel for one whole day. And all I had to do was ferry Jamun around, said Grandpa with glee.

A gleam came into Chinkoo's eyes. The prayer wheel could be his. All he had to do was wheel Jamun around. That wouldn't be so hard, he thought excitedly.",8,CC-BY,Vibhy Batra,,en,0407_jamun-has-her-wish.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0407,pb
"He happily took over the prayer wheel and the wheelchair and away they went.

Down the glistening meadows, up the narrow trails.

Jamun had never had so much fun.",9,CC-BY,Vibhy Batra,,en,0407_jamun-has-her-wish.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0407,pb

Ranjit had been waiting all evening for his parents to return from work. He generally would manage himself from 7pm onwards until 8pm. That is after the nanny has left and he is alone at home waiting for his parents. He was 11 years and thought he could manage himself for an hour by himself. But today he was feeling uneasy. He wanted his mum or dad to be around,0,CC-BY,Reshma Krishnamurthy Sharma,,en,0409_the-wait.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0409,pb
"He was at the window for some time now. Mum would anytime be home. He kept telling it to himself. He was not keen to watch TV; the activity he does when nanny leaves for her home. Dinner was cooked but he was not really hungry. He remembered on his good friend Meenu who would love seeing the stars. She had shown how the sky looked beautiful from her home window. He too was staying in a tall building and his home was on the 19th floor. But all he could stare was traffic, buildings and and city lights.",1,CC-BY,Reshma Krishnamurthy Sharma,,en,0409_the-wait.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0409,pb
"Meenu was a good friend who helped him in his studies and he liked talking to her. Today she wasn't at her home too. Her mother answered the phone and told him she has gone out to play with the apartment friends.

She asked him if he was alright as Meenu's mum knew he would be alone at home this time. He said he was doing fine and kept the phone. He just wanted someone to be with him in his home.",2,CC-BY,Reshma Krishnamurthy Sharma,,en,0409_the-wait.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0409,pb
"Just then the door bell rang. His mom was there. Ranjit rushed to hug his mum.

Talking about the nanny and sensing perhaps Ranjit was feeling lonely without company, His mom told him "" I will tell Sheela to be here for the next few days until I come or request her to drop you by 6pm to my office. Is that good. Ranjit was feeling about the change and was now smiling. He felt good and post dinner read a lot of stories with his mum and dad. The day ended well.",3,CC-BY,Reshma Krishnamurthy Sharma,,en,0409_the-wait.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0409,pb
"Have you heard of the World Wide Web? No? Never mind.

Now, have you heard of the Internet? Yes? Great!

But what IS the Internet? Did you say “I am not quite sure, but I know it has something to do with computers”? You're right – it does. But that's not the whole answer.

What's the WHOLE answer then? Hmmm. We need an EXPERT to answer that. And guess what - I know JUST the person! She's usually to be found near a computer, so let's go straight to the computer now.",0,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0410_inside-the-world-wide-web.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0410,pb
"Hi Nettikutti! Here is a group of kids to meet you! Come on out, come on out, wherever you are!

THERE you are! Go on, kids, say hello! And don't be fooled by her cuteness and her size – she holds a LOT of information in her little head!",1,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0410_inside-the-world-wide-web.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0410,pb
"So Nettikutti, here's what everyone wants to know - What IS the Internet?

Ooooh. BIG question. Let's see how I can put it simply.

The Internet (short for ‘INTERconnected NETworks') is a large, large, LARGE collection of computers from all over the world that are connected to each other.",2,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0410_inside-the-world-wide-web.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0410,pb
"The computers could be gigantic computers (the kind research laboratories or governments own), desktop computers (the kind you see in banks and computer centres), laptops (the kind people sling across their shoulders and carry with them), cellphones (the kind that ring so loudly and annoyingly in movie halls), and even the little music players with the itty-bitty headphones that seem to grow out of people's ears.",3,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0410_inside-the-world-wide-web.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0410,pb
"All these computers are connected with each other either by real wires and cables - cables that run above the ground, underground, even under the sea (big computers) - OR by wireless signals (laptops, cellphones, music players).

So you see, you don't have to be sitting in one place and have your computer plugged into an electric socket to be on the Internet – you can even be connected to the world while you are on the move!",4,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0410_inside-the-world-wide-web.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0410,pb
"That's it? We thought the Internet was about talking to friends and downloading film songs and booking movie tickets and looking for information for school projects and finding the telephone number of a hospital!

But that's not the Internet. All THAT is part of something truly magical, something called... wait for it.... the World Wide Web! This World Wide Web - let's call it W3 for short – is a large, large, LARGE collection of what are called PAGES (there are some 40 BILLION public pages on the W3 now!).",5,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0410_inside-the-world-wide-web.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0410,pb
"A page could contain information in the form of words, numbers, photographs, songs, video clips, and more. This collection of pages (or the W3) ‘sits' on the Internet, in those millions of computers and cell phones and music players. The Internet is a network of networks made up of computers, laptops, tablets and mobile phones. W3 is a collection of connected pages, that is on the Internet.

So the W3 is NOT the Internet itself, but one PART of it, the coolest part. If you think of the Internet as a restaurant, then the W3 is the most popular dish on the menu. And the spoon that helps you dig into this dish and get to your favourite bits of it is called a ‘Web Browser'.",6,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0410_inside-the-world-wide-web.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0410,pb
"Oooooh! Now you've made us hungry, Nettikutti! But do tell us more about what makes the W3 so popular.

Sure! The W3 is super-exciting because it includes:

Email – which allows you to send letters to anyone anywhere in the world – and have them receive it in under a minute! The same letter – if you were sending it to someone in America, say, would have taken 15 days to reach him if you had mailed it through a post office. And it would have cost you a lot of money too. But email is free!",7,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0410_inside-the-world-wide-web.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0410,pb
"Search – which helps you find useful – and useless! – information on a million different subjects.

You may want to know which states the River Ganga flows through, or see what the Statue of Liberty looks like. You may want to hear the latest film song of your favourite actor, or watch an episode of a serial that you missed. You may want to find out the score in the T20 World Cup, or see if there are tickets available on the Mumbai-Pune train tomorrow.

If someone whose computer is connected to the Internet, somewhere in the world, has decided to share this information with the world and put it on the W3, you will be able to find it - instantly! And for free!",8,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0410_inside-the-world-wide-web.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0410,pb
"But Nettikutti, HOW do you find the page that you want, out of all those billions of pages?

Easy! Each page also has a unique ‘address' which helps your Web Browser find it, just like your home address helps the postman to find your house. So if you know the page's address, you can go to it immediately.

What if you don't know the page's address? No problem! You can use a wonderful service called a ‘Search Engine', which also sits on the W3, to help you.",9,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0410_inside-the-world-wide-web.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0410,pb
"Sharing – which helps you share ANYTHING you want – a song you love, your dog's picture, a clever way to solve a difficult maths problem, your big idea for keeping our streets free of litter – with everyone in the world! No single person owns the Internet or the W3, and no government has authority over it*, so you don't need to ask ANYONE for permission before you share.

Think about how cool that is! Until now, you had books and movies and television and newspapers giving you information, ‘talking' to you, but YOU couldn't talk back to THEM. With the W3, everything has changed – you can listen, and YOU CAN HAVE YOUR SAY too. And you don't have to be an important person or a grown-up to do this. THIS is what makes the W3 so fantastic – it is a truly free and open AND democratic system – it gives EVERYONE who is connected to the Internet a VOICE.

*Governments do 'control' the internet in their own countries, however. Governments can even 'switch off' the internet, so that their citizens cannot access it, and some have actually done so for short or long periods.",10,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0410_inside-the-world-wide-web.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0410,pb
"Wow! That's great, Nettikutti! Now, on a completely different tack – we understand why the first two Ws in W3 stand for World Wide, but why is it called a Web? Isn't it the INTERNET that is actually a web?

Good question! You're right about the Internet being a web (because of all those computers being connected to each other), but SO IS THE W3. Let me explain.

Remember those billions of pages that the W3 is made of? THEY are all connected, or ‘hyperlinked', to each other as well! That means you can go from one page to another almost endlessly! Do you see now how the W3 is ALSO a web, a HU-MUN-GOUS web of knowledge and information and entertainment for all humankind to enjoy and use?",11,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0410_inside-the-world-wide-web.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0410,pb
"We do, we do! Now we have to have to have to know - who was the superbrain who came up with such a wonderful idea?

I thought you'd never ask! For the answer to that question, we have to go back in time some 20 years, to a nuclear research laboratory called CERN in Switzerland. Many scientists there, and across other labs in Europe, were working on projects together, but there was no way to share their work with each other quickly and easily. They would have to actually travel to each others' labs, or use the post office and courier services, to let their teams know how far they had progressed.",12,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0410_inside-the-world-wide-web.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0410,pb
"One of the scientists at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee, was getting a little fed up of this, so he decided to figure out a way to share information better and faster. He came up with a big idea called ‘hypertext' – a way of linking information on computers together – to do this.

The idea worked really well for CERN, and everyone was really happy. And THEN - Tim Berners-Lee had his SECOND big idea.",13,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0410_inside-the-world-wide-web.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0410,pb
"He felt his invention would benefit other people as well, and that it would be selfish to limit it to CERN. He talked to the authorities at CERN, and persuaded them to let him share the idea of hypertext with other scientists all over the world, for free. They agreed! Berners-Lee shared his idea, and urged everyone he shared it with to improve it or add to it as they wished.

The idea of being able to access and share information from anywhere on earth instantly was SO powerful and SO attractive that a LOT of people began to use hypertext.

Since anyone could use their own ideas to make it better, people all over the world felt they 'owned' the internet, that it was THEIRS. Which was a wonderful thing.",14,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0410_inside-the-world-wide-web.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0410,pb
"By 1993, the W3 had EXPLODED, with millions of people beginning to use it. Today, more than TWO BILLION people use the W3 in some way – that is almost one-third of all the human beings on the planet!

Hmmmm. Life would be very different today if Tim Berners-Lee had decided not to be so generous, right?

Absolutely! So don't you think we should cheer both him and the W3 with a big Hip, Hip Hurray?

We should! We should, Nettikutti!

Here we go. To Berners-Lee and the W3 - Hip Hip...

... HURRAYYYYYY!",15,CC-BY,Roopa Pai,,en,0410_inside-the-world-wide-web.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0410,pb

She was an ordinary girl. Ordinary intelligence. Ordinary looks. Nothing exceptional, brilliant, or one-of-a-kind about her. She was like a few of you and most of me. Very very average.

"Nilofar had a dream. It would visit her again and again. If ever she woke up before it was complete, the next day she would start from exactly where she had left. She controlled that dream as it were. At times she wondered if indeed it was a dream!

"All colours ran through the kite like haunted rivers. Nervous yellow peeped from the right and leapt on to bold orange at the left. Deep hopeful green jetted down the middle, embraced the silky silver, felt the angry brown, before losing itself into sleepy blue. One strong breeze and all the colours would begin to shiver. Nilofar, however, would dance in the sky like a fearless boat, unmindful of the terrifying tides of a tumultuous sea.",3,CC-BY,Arun Kumar,,en,0411_nilofar.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0411,pb
"She would notice the inviting football in the middle of the vast field and run like a warrior and kick it with the power unfamiliar to her. Before the swoosh sound of the net receiving the ball could end, she would jump from one tree to another, with a group of pigeons, koels, and sparrows resting on her stretched arms. One summersault and she would be on the back of her favourite black horse that would carry her from magical mountains to the inviting plains.",4,CC-BY,Arun Kumar,,en,0411_nilofar.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0411,pb

She tries to fly away, without looking behind, she is trying harder... the kite is getting smaller... hardly able to bear her weight... He is going to catch her any moment now. She is breathless.

At home, Shreya's mother and father were nice to her. Father would come home and pat her head when he got home in the evening. He always asked, ""What has my little Shreyu been up to today?""

Mother was a painter. Every day, she taught Shreya how to draw something or the other. Today she said, ""Shreyu, come learn how to draw an elephant.""

Shreya did not come to her. She was sad. Roshni had made her cry today. ""Mother, may I take a walk outside?"" Shreya asked and ran outside as soon as she said yes.",0,CC-BY,Sudesna Ghosh,,en,0412_the-magic-pond.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0412,pb

Shreya finally stopped running when she reached the pond. She threw off her shoes. She sat down. A bird was watching her. ""Hello, bird,"" she said. It flew away.

Poor Shreya looked into the clear water of the pond. “Even the bird does not like me,” she thought. She was tired from crying. Her head was hurting. So she took off her sweater and put it under her head. A few minutes later, Shreya was sound asleep.

"Suddenly, she heard someone. “You are beautiful. Do you know that?” Shreya looked around.

“Here, in the water,” said the voice. Shreya looked. Her eyes became huge. It was a little fairy. She looked friendly. Shreya felt her mouth turn into a smile. Nobody had called her beautiful before. She said thank you.

The angel disappeared. Bubbles danced around the water. Shreya stood there, wondering what was going to happen next. Then she saw her own reflection in the water.

""My eyes are not so small! Oh, my nose is quite nice."" Shreya went home with a smile.",2,CC-BY,Sudesna Ghosh,,en,0412_the-magic-pond.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0412,pb

The teacher said, ""Glad to see you smiling, Shreya.""

On her way home, Shreya stopped at the pond. She kept her bag down and smiled at the water.

Chimni was three years old. She was a fair, tall and thin girl with silky brownish-black hair and a gaze that confused all the adults around her. She could stare for a long time, without really seeing anything. Or so the grown-ups thought. They could never guess what went on in her head every now and then.",0,CC-BY,Arun Kumar,,en,0413_chimni.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0413,pb
"Chimni lived in an orphanage with eight other children. All the caretakers were didis. The owner was everyone's Mummy. There was no Papa. Every now and then some couples would show up and become friendly with one of the children. The didis would tell that child, ‘this is your Mummy now and this is your Papa'.

Then the couple would take that child ‘home'. Some times the children would miss their departed friend for a long time. Some times the arrival of a new friend in the orphanage would ease their pain.

-‘These kids know now what a home is, what Papa and Mummy are.'

-‘It's good that the younger ones forget things quickly'.

The didis talked among themselves and did their chores.",1,CC-BY,Arun Kumar,,en,0413_chimni.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0413,pb
"-‘Imagine what Chimni would do if she understood more!'

Chimni appeared to be just like other children – hungry for love, tender with younger children, fiercely competitive with others.

And yet there was something unique about her.

She was attracted to birds more than any other child in the orphanage. She would watch them for hours if she could. In fact, didis thought, she even walked and talked like a sparrow, or Chimni, in Marathi.

Chimni often talked to the birds that came close to her window. Waving vigorously, she would ask several questions and tell many tales to them in a language known only to her and the birds.",2,CC-BY,Arun Kumar,,en,0413_chimni.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0413,pb
"‘Choon Choon cheewn cheewn! What you ate? What you drank? Where you went? What you saw? Can I fly with you? Wait, I will get my blanket....'

-‘She talks to the birds.'

-‘I have seen her sing to them.'

-‘She may have been a bird in her previous life.'

-‘She is definitely a bird in this life.'

The didis would talk among themselves and do their chores.

And one day everything changed.

No one knows if Chimni saw it coming. Tears were rolling down the cheeks of didis. The older children looked sad. The young ones were hidden behind the doors.

-‘They are too young to take all this', explained one of the caretakers.",3,CC-BY,Arun Kumar,,en,0413_chimni.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0413,pb
"-‘Get a thali and kumkum,' the owner of the orphanage called out. ‘Our daughter is going away. Take her in your lap and sit; we will do a little pooja.'

-‘But, she is going to her home,' muttered the father-to-be.

-‘Yes', managed the mother-to-be, visibly choking on all this.

-‘Why is everyone looking so sad? Get the sweets; give them to children.'

-‘Chimni, you are looking beautiful, my darling! What a lovely frock Papa and Mummy have brought for you.

Chimni was quiet, very quiet. Her eyes were piercing through every pair of eyes that dared to look at hers. The new Papa stretched his hands to pick her up. Chimni did not resist, just tilted her head away from the room and looked towards the small garden outside the veranda. There were no birds there.",4,CC-BY,Arun Kumar,,en,0413_chimni.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0413,pb
"Mummy was holding Chimni's bag; it had a few of her ‘necessary' things, including the blanket. Chimni looked up in the sky. It was empty. There were no birds there.

The minute she was put in the car, Chimni yowled out loud, her hands stretched towards the orphanage building.

-‘Let's get going,' said Papa with a lump in his throat.

-‘I am feeling guilty, said Mummy, with a lump in her throat.

-‘It's ok, my little one; don't cry, we are going home,' comforted Papa.

Unable to speak, Mummy kissed Chimni and held her tight. Chimni wailed inconsolably. Sometimes she would look at both of them. Sometimes she would look behind.

Her face looked red. The eyes looked swollen.

Water was offered and refused. New toys were given and rejected.",5,CC-BY,Arun Kumar,,en,0413_chimni.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0413,pb
"Finally, Chimni pointed towards her bag. The bag was opened. She grabbed her little blanket and, hugging it, fell asleep in no time.

Mummy and Papa were worried how she would adjust. They wanted a child, a girl, they could love and who could soak in their love. But now they were worried – what if she continues to miss her friends and didis and cry all the time?

Days went by. Every day they were learning a few things about her – what she liked, what she didn't; what excited her, what scared her and so on.

Every day Chimni was learning new things about Mummy and Papa – what they liked, what they didn't; what excited them, what scared them and so on.

She would laugh with them, play with them, and go out with them.",6,CC-BY,Arun Kumar,,en,0413_chimni.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0413,pb
"One morning when they woke up they did not see Chimni in her bed.

‘Where is she?' Mummy rushed out to the bathroom. Papa followed. She wasn't there. She was not in the study. The drawing room and the kitchen too were empty. The main door was shut still.

‘Where could she go from a seventh floor apartment?' There was panic in Papa's voice. Mummy was in tears now. Both ran towards the other bathroom that had a door to a balcony. The balcony door was ajar. Before they could enter the balcony, they heard choon chewn choon.

‘Papa! Mummy! See, a Chimni has come.'

There was a little sparrow on the balcony railing – not even a foot away from her. Chimni was standing there, holding the railing, surrounded by an excited looking sparrow, who didn't seem scared of her at all.",7,CC-BY,Arun Kumar,,en,0413_chimni.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0413,pb
"Mummy hugged her. Papa embraced her and Mummy both. And together, Papa and Mummy said, 'indeed, a Chimni has come!'

Chimni freed herself, walked towards the railing, bent her head up towards the ledge of the roof. She spotted a bunch of sparrows and went on:

"Corals are both plants and animals. Thousands of little algae live inside corals, and give them energy to grow. They have hard outer skeletons and grow into many different shapes.

Plankton is the main source of food for many sea creatures. They are a mix of algae, bacteria, tiny animals, and the eggs and larvae of larger animals that float about with the ocean currents.

Feather stars may look like plants, but they're really animals. They use their feather-like ‘arms' to catch and eat bits of floating plankton.",15,CC-BY,Rajiv Eipe,,en,0416_dive.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0416,pb
"Parrotfish have strong teeth that form a parrot-like beak, which they use to scrape algae off hard coral. Some species don't mind eating bits of coral as well, and they later poop out a fine sand that washes up on land to form beautiful white beaches.

Clownfish and sea anemones live together and help each other. The clownfish help the anemones by cleaning their tentacles and luring other fish for the anemone to eat. The anemones, in turn, allow the clownfish to hide among their poisonous tentacles without stinging them.

Cleaner wrasses are small fish that keep bigger fish clean by feeding on their parasites and dead skin. The bigger fish recognise the wrasses by their colours and the dance-like way they move.",16,CC-BY,Rajiv Eipe,,en,0416_dive.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0416,pb
"The reef octopus can hide by changing its colour and texture. It makes its home in holes in the reef, or buries itself in the sand.

Ghost pipefish can be found in pairs, floating with their heads down and hidden among sea grass, corals or feather stars. Like the reef octopus, they can change colour to blend in perfectly.

The whitetip reef shark has a thin body, broad head, and white tips on its dorsal and tail fin. They hunt at night, and sleep through most of the day.",17,CC-BY,Rajiv Eipe,,en,0416_dive.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0416,pb
"The hawksbill turtle has a flat body, a shell with jagged edges, and a sharp, curving mouth that looks like a hawk's beak.

Manta rays are huge fish with wing-like fins on the sides of their bodies. These large fins help them swim gracefully through the water. On some manta rays, the distance from one wing tip to the other can reach up to 23 feet!

The dugong is a vegetarian marine mammal. Its favourite food is sea grass, which it is able to graze on with its specially-shaped snout. Dugongs are also called sea cows.",18,CC-BY,Rajiv Eipe,,en,0416_dive.md,global-asp/pb-source,eng,Latn,pb_0416,pb

"Here is a tree.

The tree is on the ground.

Its roots are in the soil.

Soil covers the roots.

The trunk stands above.

Branches spread from the trunk.

Leaves sprout from the branches.

Flowers bloom by the leaves.

Fruits grow from flowers.

And inside the fruit is a seed.

And green grass grows all around.

"Soon...

A tiny little plant will come from the seed. One day it will be a tree.

And green grass will grow all around.
